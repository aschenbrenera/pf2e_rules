## Mechanical Rules

- When you get a critical success using the Lie action, the target’s attitude toward you improves by one step.
	- This is as though you’d succeeded at using Diplomacy to [[Make an Impression]]. 
	- This works only once per conversation.
	- If you critically succeed against multiple targets using the same result, you choose one creature’s attitude to improve. 
	- You must be lying to impart seemingly important information, inflate your status, or ingratiate yourself, which trivial or irrelevant lies can’t achieve.
