**Level:** 1
**Traits:** `GENERAL` `SKILL`
**Prerequisites:**Â Trained in [[Society]]
**Description:** You know about life on the streets and feel the pulse of your local settlement.

## Mechanical Rules

- You can use your [[Society]] modifier instead of your Diplomacy modifier to [[Gather Information]].
- In any settlement you frequent regularly, you can use the [[Recall Knowledge]] action with Society to know the same sorts of information that you could discover with Diplomacy to Gather Information.
	- The DC is usually significantly higher, but you know the information without spending time gathering it. If you fail to recall the information, you can still subsequently attempt to Gather Information normally.
