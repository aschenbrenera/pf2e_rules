**Level:** 1
**Traits:** `GENERAL` `SKILL`
**Prerequisites:** Trained in [[Performance]]
**Description:** You can attempt to fascinate an observer while performing.
## Mechanical Rules

- When you [[Perform]], compare your result to the Will DC of one observer.
	- You must choose which creature you're trying to fascinate before you roll your check, and the target is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.  
	- If you're an expert in [[Performance]], you can fascinate up to four observers.
	- If you're a master in Performance, you can fascinate up to 10 observers.
	- If you're legendary in Performance, you can fascinate any number of observers at the same time.
	- **Success:** The target is [[Fascinated]] by you for 1 round.
		- If the observer is in a situation that demands immediate attention, such as combat, you must critically succeed to fascinate it and the Perform action gains the `INCAPCITATION` trait.

## Gameplay Interaction

- Follows the rules for the [[Incapacitation]] trait.
	- If a spell has the incapacitation trait, any creature of more than twice the spell’s rank treats the result of their check to prevent being incapacitated by the spell as one degree of success better, or the result of any check the spellcaster made to incapacitate them as one degree of success worse.
	- If any other effect has the incapacitation trait, a creature of higher level than the item, creature, or hazard generating the effect gains the same benefits.
