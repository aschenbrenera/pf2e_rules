**Level:** 1
**Traits:** `GENERAL` `SKILL`
**Prerequisites:** Trained in [[Thievery]]
**Description:** You are better at taking items while avoiding detection.
## Mechanical Rules

- When you successfully [[Steal]] something, observers (creatures other than the creature you stole from) take a –2 circumstance penalty to their Perception DCs to detect your theft.
- Additionally, if you first [[Create a Diversion]] using Deception, taking a single [[Palm an Object]] or Steal action doesn’t end your [[Undetected]] condition.
