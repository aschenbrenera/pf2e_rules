**Level:** 1
**Traits:** `GENERAL` `SKILL`
**Prerequisites:** Trained in [[Thievery]]
**Description:** You are better at taking closely guarded objects.
## Mechanical Rules

- You can [[Steal]] or [[Palm an Object]] that’s closely guarded, such as in a pocket, without taking the –5 penalty.
	- You can’t steal objects that would be extremely noticeable or time consuming to remove (like worn shoes or armor or actively wielded objects).
- If you’re a master in Thievery, you can attempt to Steal from a creature in combat or otherwise on guard.
	- When doing so, Stealing requires 2 actions instead of 1, and you take a –5 penalty.
