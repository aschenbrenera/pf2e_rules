**Traits:** `GENERAL` `SKILL` `HEALING` `MANIPULATE`
**Prerequisite:** Trained in [[Medicine]].
**Requirements:** You're holding or wearing a [[Healer's toolkit]].
**Description:** You can patch up wounds, even in combat.
## Mechanical Rules

- Attempt a [[Medicine]] check with the same DC as for [[Treat Wounds]] and restore the corresponding amount of HP.
	- This doesn’t remove the wounded condition.
	- As with Treat Wounds, you can attempt checks against higher DCs if you have the minimum proficiency rank.
- The target is then immune to your Battle Medicine for 1 day. This does not make them immune to, or otherwise count as, Treat Wounds.
