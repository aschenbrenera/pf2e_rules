**Description:** When your enemy can't properly defend itself, you take advantage to deal extra damage.
## Mechanical Rules

-  If you Strike a creature that has the [[Off-Guard]] condition with a valid attack you deal an extra 1d6 [[Damage Types|Precision Damage]].
- Valid attacks include using:
	- A ranged weapon attack (not including thrown weapons), or a ranged unarmed attack.
	- An attack with the [[Agile]] or [[Finesse]] traits using a melee weapon, a thrown melee weapon, or an unarmed attack.
- As your rogue level increases, so does the number of damage dice for your sneak attack. Increase the number of dice by one at 5th, 11th, and 17th levels.
