Through dedicated study and practice, you can construct spells with academic rigor by shaping arcane magic. As a wizard, when you cast spells, your incantations likely specify exactly what forces you call on and how to shape them, and your gestures precisely shape and direct your magic while circles of arcane runes flare to life.  

Every arcane spell has a written version, which you record in your personalized book of spells. You receive your spellbook for free and must study each day to prepare your spells. Your spellbook's form and name are up to you. It might be a musty, leather-bound tome or an assortment of thin metal disks connected to a brass ring; its name might be esoteric, like _The Tome of Silent Shadows_ or something more academic, like _Advanced Pyromantic Applications of Jalmeri Elemental Theory_.  

## Mechanical Rules

- You are a spellcaster. You prepare spells by studying your [[Spellbook]] during [[Rest|Daily Preparations]]. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots. 
	- The number of ranked spells and cantrips you can prepare is shown in the Wizard Spells per Day table.
	- You also get to prepare one extra curriculum cantrip and one extra curriculum spell of each rank you can cast from your arcane school.
	- Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again.
- You can cast spells of the arcane tradition using the [[Cast a Spell]] activity. 
	- Some spells will require [[Spell attack rolls]] or have your enemies roll against your spell DC.
	- Your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Intelligence modifier.
- Cantrips:
	-  A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots.
	- You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day.
	- A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up— this is usually equal to the highest rank of wizard spell slot you have.
- Heightening Spells:
	- When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks.
- Spellbook:
	- Starting Spells:
		- The spellbook starts with your choice of 10 arcane cantrips and five 1st-rank arcane spells. You choose these from the common spells on the [arcane spell list](https://2e.aonprd.com/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=1) or from other arcane spells you gain access to.
		- You also add two 1st-rank spells from the curriculum of your arcane school (except in the case of the school of unified magical theory, as described in that school). 
	- Gaining Spells:
		- Each time you gain a level, you add two arcane spells to your spellbook, of any spell rank for which you have spell slots, chosen from common spells of your tradition or others you gain access to.
		- When you gain spell slots of a new rank, you also add an additional spell from your school's curriculum (unless it's the school of unified magical theory).
		- You can also add spells to your spellbook with the [[Learn Spell]] activity.
