**Actions:** [1] ⬥
**Traits:** `CONCENTRATE` `RANGER`
**Description:** You designate a single creature as your prey and gain benefits against it.

## Mechanical Rules

- You designate a single creature as your prey.
	- You must be able to see or hear the prey, or you must be tracking the prey during exploration.
	- You can have only one creature designated as your prey at a time. If you use Hunt Prey against a creature when you already have a creature designated, the prior creature loses the designation and the new prey gains the designation.
	- Your designation lasts until your next daily preparations.
- You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to:
	- Perception checks when you [[Seek]] your prey 
	- [[Survival]] checks when you [[Track]] your prey.
- You also ignore the penalty for making ranged attacks within your second range increment against the prey you're hunting.
