Your deity's power grants you special divine spells called devotion spells, which are a type of focus spell.

Choose either [Shields of the spirit] or a spell based on your deity's divine font ([[Lay on hands]] if your deity allows heal, [Touch of the void] if your deity allows harm).  

## Mechanical Rules

- **Devotion Spells**:
	- Devotion spells are types of [[Focus Spells]].
	- Your devotion spells are divine spells. Your spellcasting attribute is Charisma.  
	- It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point.
		- You can't prepare a focus spell in a spell slot or use your spell slots to cast focus spells.
		- You can't spend your Focus Points to cast spells that aren't focus spells.
		- The maximum number of points in your pool is equal to the number of focus spells you know or 3, whichever is lower. 
	- Casting any of your focus spells always costs you 1 Focus Point.
	- Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, just like cantrips are.
	- You can't cast a focus spell if its minimum rank is greater than half your level rounded up, even if you somehow gain access to it.
	- You replenish all the Focus Points in your pool during your [[Rest|Daily Preparations]].
	- You can also use the [[Refocus]] activity activity to pray to your deity or do service toward their causes and regain 1 Focus Point.
