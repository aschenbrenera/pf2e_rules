**Description:** Depending on your deity, their sanctification can make you holy or unholy. This commits you to one side of a struggle over souls. Whether you become holy, unholy, or neither will limit your choice of causes, devotion spells, and feats.  

If you “can be” holy or unholy according to your deity's sanctification entry, you make that choice, and if you “must be” holy or unholy, you gain the trait automatically.
If the deity lists “none,” you can choose only options that don't require the holy or unholy trait. If you are holy or unholy and gain the opposing trait in some way, you lose the previous trait until you _atone_.  

## Mechanical Rules

- **Holy:** 
	- You gain the `HOLY` trait and add that trait to any Strikes you make. 
	- You gain the edict, “Do not knowingly harm innocents or fail to prevent harm to an innocent if your direct intervention could save them”.
	- You gain the anathema “Commit murder.” 
-  **Unholy:**
	- You gain the `UNHOLY` trait and add that trait to any Strikes you make. 
	- You gain the edict, “Do not put another's needs before your own or those of your deity”
	- You gain the anathema “Commit an entirely altruistic act, such as giving something away in charity” and “Put anyone's needs before those of your deity.”
