Minions are creatures that directly serve another creature. 
## Mechanical Rules

- Once per turn, during your turn, the minion gains 2 actions if one of the following occurs:
	- If not otherwise specified, you issue a verbal command as a single action with the `AUDITORY` and `CONCENTRATE` traits. 
	- For most minions, you use the Command an Animal action to command it; this replaces the usual effects of [[Command an Animal]], and you don’t need to attempt a Nature check. 
	- For summoned minions, you use the [[Sustain]] action.
- If given no commands, minions use no actions except to defend themselves or to escape obvious harm.
- A minion has 0 reactions.
- You can have a maximum of four minions under your control.  
- A minion can't control other creatures.
