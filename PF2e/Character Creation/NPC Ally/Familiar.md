Familiars are mystically bonded creatures tied to your magic. Most familiars were originally animals, though the ritual of becoming a familiar makes them something more. Common choices for familiars include bats, cats, foxes, ravens, and snakes. Some familiars are different, usually described in the ability that granted you a familiar; for example, a druid’s leshy familiar has the plant or fungus trait instead of animal.

## Mechanical Rules

- You gain the [[Pet]] general feat, except that your pet has special abilities.  
	- Your pet’s level is equal to yours.
	- Your pet has 5 Hit Points per level.
	- Your pet has low-light vision.
	- Your pet has a Speed of 25 feet. You can choose to instead have an aquatic pet, which breathes in water instead of air and has the aquatic trait, no land Speed, and a swim Speed of 25 feet.
	- It has the minion trait:
		- It gains 2 actions during your turn if you use the Command an Animal action to command it; this replaces the usual effects of Command an Animal, and you don’t need to attempt a Nature check. If not otherwise specified, you issue a verbal command as a single action with the `AUDITORY` and `CONCENTRATE` traits. 
		- If given no commands, minions use no actions except to defend themselves or to escape obvious harm.
		- A minion has 0 reactions.
		- You can have a maximum of four minions under your control.  
	- A pet can’t make Strikes.
- A familiar is different from a basic pet in the following ways.
	- **Modifiers and AC:** For Perception, Acrobatics, and Stealth, you can have your familiar use your spellcasting attribute modifier + your level instead of 3 + your level if it’s higher. 
	- **Communication:** Your familiar can communicate empathically with you as long as it’s within 1 mile of you, sharing emotions. It doesn’t understand or speak languages normally, but it can gain speech from a familiar ability. 
	- **Abilities:**  Instead of choosing two abilities only when you gain your familiar as you do with a normal pet, you can choose the two abilities each day during your [[Rest|Daily Preparations]]. You can choose from familiar abilities and master abilities. You can choose the pet abilities from the feat as familiar abilities as well. You can’t swap out abilities that are innate to your familiar. For example, you couldn’t choose not to give a raven familiar flying.  
- When “companion” is used in a stat block, it refers to animal companions, familiars, and other types of companions.
