## Mechanical Rules

- Your pet's size is Tiny.
- Your pet’s level is equal to yours.
- Your pet has 5 Hit Points per level.
- Your pet has low-light vision.

- Your pet gets 2 [[Pet, Familiar, and Master Abilities|Pet Abilities]].
- It has the minion trait:
	- It gains 2 actions during your turn if you use the Command an Animal action to command it; this replaces the usual effects of Command an Animal, and you don’t need to attempt a Nature check. If not otherwise specified, you issue a verbal command as a single action with the `AUDITORY` and `CONCENTRATE` traits. 
	- If given no commands, minions use no actions except to defend themselves or to escape obvious harm.
	- A minion has 0 reactions.
	- You can have a maximum of four minions under your control.
