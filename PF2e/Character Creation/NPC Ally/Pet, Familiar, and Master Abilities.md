## Familiar Abilities

Familiar abilities primarily affect the familiar itself. A familiar can have no more than one ability that changes its creature trait (such as construct or plant).

- **Accompanist:** Your familiar helps you perform. Whenever you attempt a Performance check, if your familiar is nearby and can act, it accompanies you with chirps, claps, or its own miniature instrument. This grants you a +1 circumstance bonus, or +2 if you're a master in Performance.  
- **Construct:** Your familiar has the `CONSTRUCT` trait instead of the `ANIMAL` trait. The familiar is immune to [death](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [doomed](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=9), [drained](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=10), [fatigued](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=15), [healing](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=89), [nonlethal](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=188) attacks, [paralyzed](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [poison](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=126), [sickened](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=34), [spirit](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=149), [unconscious](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=38), [vitality](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=509), and [void](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=510). Your familiar must have the tough pet ability to select this.  
- **Damage Avoidance:** Choose one type of save. Your familiar takes no damage when it rolls a success on that type of save; this doesn't prevent effects other than damage.  
- **Dragon:** Your familiar has the `DRAGON` trait instead of the `ANIMAL` trait.  
- **Elemental:** Your familiar has the `ELEMENTAL` trait instead of the `ANIMAL` trait. Choose [air](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=5), [earth](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=55), [fire](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=72), [metal](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=505), [water](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=165), or [wood](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=508). Your familiar gains that trait. The familiar is immune to [bleed](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=29), [paralyzed](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [poison](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=126), [sleep](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=145), and the element matching its trait. Your familiar must have the resistance familiar ability to select this.  
- **Focused Rejuvenation:** When you Refocus, you generate magical energy that heals your familiar. Your familiar regains 1 Hit Point per level whenever you Refocus.
- **Fungus:** Your familiar has the `FUNGUS` trait instead of the `ANIMAL` trait.  
- **Independent:** In an encounter, if you don't Command your familiar, it still gains 1 action each round. Typically, you still decide how it spends that action, but, the GM might determine that your familiar chooses its own tactics rather than performing your preferred action. This doesn't work with valet or similar abilities that require a command, if you're capable of riding your familiar, or similar situations.  
- **Item Delivery:** If your familiar is adjacent to you, you can Command it to deliver an item. Instead of its normal 2 actions, your familiar Interacts to take an item you’re holding of light Bulk or less, then takes one move action, then finally Interacts to pass off the item to another willing creature. It can instead administer the item to the creature if it can do so with 1 action and has an appropriate type of item (such as alchemical elixir). If your familiar doesn’t reach the target this turn, it holds the item until commanded otherwise. Your familiar must have the manual dexterity ability to select this.  
- **Kinspeech:** Your familiar can understand and speak with animals of the same species. To select this, your familiar must be an animal, it must have the speech ability, and you must be at least 6th level.
- **Major Resistance:** Your familiar increases the resistance it gains from its resistance familiar ability to a value equal to your level. To select this you must be at least 8th level.  
- **Master's Form:** Your familiar can change shape as a single action, transforming into a humanoid of your ancestry with the same age, gender, and build of its true form, though it always maintains a clearly unnatural remnant of its nature, such as a cat's eyes or a serpent's tongue. This form is always the same each time it uses this ability. This otherwise uses the effects of [_humanoid form_](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=153), except the change is purely cosmetic. It only appears humanoid and gains no new capabilities. Your familiar must have the manual dexterity and speech abilities to select this. 
- **Partner in Crime:** Your familiar is your criminal associate. Despite being a minion, your familiar gains 1 reaction at the start of its turns, which it can use only to Aid you on a Deception or Thievery skill check (it still has to prepare to help you as normal for the Aid reaction). It automatically succeeds at its check to Aid you with those skills or automatically critically succeeds if you're a master of the skill in question.  
- **Plant:** Your familiar has the `PLANT` trait instead of the `ANIMAL` trait.  
- **Plant Form:** Your plant familiar can change shape as a single action, transforming into a Tiny plant of a type roughly similar to the familiar's nature. This otherwise uses the effects of [_one with plants_](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1618). You must have a familiar with the `PLANT` trait to select this ability.  
- **Resistance:** Choose two of the following: acid, cold, electricity, fire, poison, or sonic. Your familiar gains resistance equal to half your level (minimum resistance 1) against the chosen damage types.  
- **Second Opinion:** Your familiar is your academic confidant. Despite being a minion, your familiar gains 1 reaction at the start of its turns, which it can use only to Aid you on a Recall Knowledge skill check for a skill in which it has the skilled familiar ability (it still has to prepare to help you as normal for the Aid reaction). It automatically succeeds at its check to Aid you with those skills or automatically critically succeeds if you’re a master of the skill in question.  
- **Skilled:** Choose a skill other than Acrobatics or Stealth. Your familiar's modifier for that skill is equal to your level plus your spellcasting attribute modifier, rather than just your level. You can select this ability repeatedly, choosing a different skill each time.  
- **Speech:** Your familiar understands and speaks a language you know.  
- **Spellcasting:** Choose a spell in your repertoire or that you prepared today at least 5 ranks lower than your highest-rank spell slot. Your familiar can Cast that Spell once per day using your magical tradition, spell attack modifier, and spell DC. If the spell has a drawback that affects the caster, both you and your familiar are affected. You must be able to cast 6th-rank spells using spell slots to select this.  
- **Toolbearer:** Your familiar can carry a toolkit of up to light Bulk. So long as your familiar is adjacent to you, you can draw and replace the tools as part of the action that uses them as if you were wearing them. Your familiar must have the manual dexterity ability to select this.  
- **Touch Telepathy:** Your familiar can telepathically communicate with you via touch. If it also has the Speech ability, it can telepathically communicate via touch with any creature if they share a language.  
- **Valet:** You can command your familiar to deliver you items more efficiently. Your familiar doesn't use its 2 actions immediately upon your command. Instead, up to twice before the end of your turn, you can have your familiar Interact to retrieve an item of light or negligible Bulk you are wearing and place it into one of your free hands. The familiar can't use this ability to retrieve stowed items. If the familiar has a different number of actions, it can retrieve one item for each action it has when commanded this way.  

## Master Abilities

Master abilities primarily affect you or the magic that passes between you and your familiar.

- **Absorb Familiar:** Your familiar can transform into a mark you carry on your flesh, typically seeming like a birthmark, tattoo, or gem that vaguely resembles its normal form. When transformed, the familiar can't act except to turn back into a familiar. It isn't affected by area effects and must be targeted separately to affect it, which requires knowledge that it's a creature. This means you and your allies can heal or assist the familiar while most enemies stay unaware of its true nature. Creatures must attempt a DC 20 Perception check to Seek to realize a it is actually a familiar. Your familiar can still communicate its feelings empathically. Transforming the familiar between forms is a 1-minute activity that has the `CONCENTRATE` trait.  
- **Cantrip Connection:** You can Prepare an additional cantrip or, if you have a repertoire, designate a cantrip to add to your repertoire every time you select this ability; you can retrain it but can't otherwise change it. You must be able to prepare cantrips or add them to your repertoire to select this.  
- **Extra Alchemy:** Your familiar helps you brew items at the start of the day. You can create one additional item with advanced alchemy during your Daily Preparations.  
- **Extra Vial:** Your familiar accretes alchemical liquids in its body. Once per day, you can Interact when your familiar is adjacent to you to gain a versatile vial.  
- **Familiar Focus:** Once per day, your familiar can use 2 actions with the `CONCENTRATE` trait to restore 1 Focus Point to your focus pool, up to your usual maximum. You must have a focus pool to select this.  
- **Innate Surge:** Once per day, you can draw upon your familiar's innate magic to replenish your own. You can cast one innate spell gained from an ancestry feat that you have already cast today. You must still Cast a Spell and meet the spell's other requirements.  
- **Lifelink:** If your familiar would be reduced to 0 HP by damage, as a reaction with the `CONCENTRATE` trait, you can take all the damage, and your familiar takes none. However, special effects that would occur due to that damage (such as snake venom) still apply.  
- **Recall Familiar:** Once per day, you can use a 3-action activity, which has the `CONCENTRATE` trait, to teleport your familiar to your space. Your familiar must be within 1 mile or the attempt to summon it fails. This is a Teleportation effect.  
- **Restorative Familiar:** Once per day, your familiar can use 2 actions with the `CONCENTRATE` trait to give up some of its energy and heal you. It must be in your space to do so. You restore a number of Hit Points equal to 1d8 times half your level (minimum 1d8).  
- **Share Senses:** Once every 10 minutes, you can use a single action with the `CONCENTRATE` trait to project your senses into your familiar. When you do, you lose all sensory information from your own body, but can sense through your familiar's body for up to 1 minute. You can Dismiss this effect.  
- **Spell Battery:** You gain one additional spell slot at least 3 ranks lower than your highest-rank spell slot; you must be able to cast 4th-rank spells using spell slots to select this master ability.  
- **Spell Delivery:** If your familiar is in your space, you can Cast a Spell with a range of touch, transfer its power to your familiar, and command the familiar to deliver the spell. If you do, the familiar uses its 2 actions for the round to move to a target of your choice and touch that target. If it doesn't reach the target to touch it this turn, the spell has no effect.
