**Prerequisite:** Catfolk
**Description:** You come from a long line of skilled hunters and trackers and have a particularly keen sense of smell. 

## Mechanical Rules

- You gain [[Scent]] (imprecise) 30 feet.
	- You can use smell as a Imprecise Sense within a range as stated in ability or stat block.
		-  At best, an imprecise sense can be used to make an Undetected  or Unnoticed creature merely Hidden—it can’t make the creature Observed.   You can usually sense a creature automatically with an imprecise sense making it Hidden.
			- It might still be Undetected by you if it’s using Stealth or is in an environment that distorts the sense, such as a noisy room in the case of hearing. In those cases, you have to use the Seek basic action to detect the creature. 
	- It functions only if the creature or object being detected emits an aroma.
		- If a creature emits a heavy aroma or is upwind, the GM can double or even triple the range of scent abilities used to detect that creature, and the GM can reduce the range if a creature is downwind.
- In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [[Track]] a creature or object if you've smelled it before.
