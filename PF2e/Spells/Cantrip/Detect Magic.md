Level: Cantrip 1
**Actions:** [2] ⬥⬥
**Traits:** `CANTRIP` `CONCENTRATE` `DETECTION` `MANIPULATE`

**Traditions**: arcane, divine, occult, primal 
**Spell List**: elemental
**Bloodline**: imperial

**Area:** 30-foot emanation

**Description:** You send out a pulse that registers the presence of magic. 

## Mechanical Rules

- You receive no information beyond the presence or absence of magic.
- You can choose to ignore magic you're fully aware of, such as the magic items and ongoing spells of you and your allies.  
- You detect `ILLUSION` magic only if that magic's effect has a lower rank than the rank of your _detect magic_ spell.
	- However, items that have an illusion aura but aren't deceptive in appearance (such as an invisibility potion) typically are detected normally.
- **Heightened (3rd):** You learn the rank or level of the most powerful magical effect the spell detects, as determined by the GM.
- **Heightened (4th):** You also pinpoint the source of the highest-rank magic. Like for an imprecise sense, you don't learn the exact location, but can narrow down the source to within a 5-foot cube (or the nearest if larger than that).

## Gameplay Interaction

- Cantrip spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up.
