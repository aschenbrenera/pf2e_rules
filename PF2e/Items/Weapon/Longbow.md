## Gameplay Interaction

- [[Deadly]] d10
	- On a critical hit, the weapon adds a weapon damage die of the listed size. Roll this after doubling the weapon’s damage. This increases to two dice if the weapon has a _greater striking rune_ and three dice if the weapon has a _major striking rune_. 
	- For instance, a rapier with a _greater striking rune_ deals 2d8 extra piercing damage on a critical hit. 
	- An ability that changes the size of the weapon’s normal damage dice doesn’t change the size of its deadly die.
- [[Volley]] 30 ft.
	- Your attacks against targets that are at a distance within the range listed take a –2 penalty.
- Critical Specialization - [[Bow Group]] (when granted by an ability)
	- If the target of the critical hit is adjacent to a surface, it gets stuck to that surface by the missile.
		- The target is Immobilized and must spend an Interact action to attempt a DC 10 Athletics check to pull the missile free; it can't move from its space until it succeeds. The creature doesn't become stuck if it is Incorporeal, is liquid, or could otherwise escape without effort.
