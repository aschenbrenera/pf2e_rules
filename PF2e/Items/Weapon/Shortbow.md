## Gameplay Interactions

- [[Deadly]] D10
	- On a critical hit, the weapon adds a weapon damage die of the listed size. Roll this after doubling the weapon’s damage. This increases to two dice if the weapon has a _greater striking rune_ and three dice if the weapon has a _major striking rune_. 
	- For instance, a rapier with a _greater striking rune_ deals 2d8 extra piercing damage on a critical hit. 
	- An ability that changes the size of the weapon’s normal damage dice doesn’t change the size of its deadly die.
- Critical Specialization - [[Bow Group]] (when granted by an ability)
