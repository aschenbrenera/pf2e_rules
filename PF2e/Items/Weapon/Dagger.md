## Gameplay Interactions

- [[Agile]]
	- The [[Multiple Attack Penalty]] you take with this weapon on the second attack on your turn is –4 instead of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and subsequent attacks in the turn.
	- This reduction doesn't affect future attacks with non-agile weapons.
- [[Finesse]]
	- You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls using this melee weapon. You still calculate damage using Strength.
- [[Versatile]] S
	- A versatile weapon can be used to deal a different type of damage than its listed type. This trait indicates the alternate damage type.
	- For instance, a piercing weapon with versatile S can deal piercing or slashing damage. 
	- You choose the damage type each time you attack.
- [[Thrown]] 10 Ft.
	- You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack; it is a ranged weapon when thrown.
	- You add your Strength modifier to damage as you would for a melee weapon.
	- When this trait appears on a melee weapon, it also includes the range increment.
		- Ranged weapons with this trait use the range increment in the weapon’s Range entry.
- Critical Specialization - [[Knife Group]] (when granted by an ability)
	- The target takes 1d6 [[Persistent Damage|Persistent]] [[Damage Types|Bleed Damage]]. You gain an item bonus to this bleed damage equal to the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls.
