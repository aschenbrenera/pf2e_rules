## Gameplay Interactions

- [[Agile]]
	- The [[Multiple Attack Penalty]] you take with this weapon on the second attack on your turn is –4 instead of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and subsequent attacks in the turn.
	- This reduction doesn't affect future attacks with non-agile weapons.
- [[Finesse]]
	- You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls using this melee weapon. You still calculate damage using Strength.
- [[Versatile]] S
	- A versatile weapon can be used to deal a different type of damage than its listed type. This trait indicates the alternate damage type.
	- For instance, a piercing weapon with versatile S can deal piercing or slashing damage. 
	- You choose the damage type each time you attack.
- Critical Specialization - [[Sword Group]] (when granted by an ability)
	- The target is made off-balance by your attack, becoming [[Off-Guard]] until the start of your next turn.
