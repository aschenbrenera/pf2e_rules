This satchel includes 50 feet of [[Rope]], pulleys, a dozen [[Piton]], a hammer, a [[Grappling Hook]] and one set of crampons.

Climbing kits allow you to attach yourself to the wall you're [[Climb|Climbing]], moving half as quickly as usual (minimum 5 feet) but letting you attempt a DC 5 flat check whenever you critically fail to prevent a fall. 
- To affix a piton, you must hold it in one hand and use a hammer to drive it in with your other hand. You can attach a rope to the hammered piton so that you don't fall all the way to the ground on a critical failure while Climbing.

A single kit has only enough materials for one climber; each climber needs their own kit. If you wear your climbing kit, you can access it as part of a Climb action.

## Gameplay Interaction

- You can make a toolkit easier to use by [[Wearing Toolkits]]. This easy access allows you to draw and replace the tools within as part of the action that uses them, rather than needing to Interact to draw them. You can wear up to 2 Bulk of toolkits in this manner; any beyond this limit must be stowed or drawn with an Interact action to use.
