You need a thieves' toolkit to [[Pick a Lock]] or [[Disable a Device]] (of some types) using the Thievery skill. If your thieves' toolkit is broken, you can repair it by replacing the lock picks with replacement picks appropriate to your toolkit (standard 3 sp,  infiltrator 3gp). Replacing picks doesn't require using the Repair action.

## Gameplay Interaction

- You can make a toolkit easier to use by [[Wearing Toolkits]]. This easy access allows you to draw and replace the tools within as part of the action that uses them, rather than needing to Interact to draw them. You can wear up to 2 Bulk of toolkits in this manner; any beyond this limit must be stowed or drawn with an Interact action to use.
