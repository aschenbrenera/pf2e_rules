You can throw a grappling hook with a rope tied to it to make a [[Climb]] easier. The typical DC for climbing a rope is 15, which may be preferable to more challenging surfaces.
A grappling hook can be found in a [[Climbing Kit]].

To anchor a grappling hook, make a ranged attack roll using your simple weapon proficiency against a DC depending on the target, typically at least DC 20. This attack has the `SECRET` trait. 
On a success, your hook has a firm hold, but on a critical failure, the hook seems like it will hold but actually falls when you're partway up.
