The ways a creature can use Perception depend on what senses it has. The primary concepts you need to know for understanding senses are precise senses, imprecise senses, and the three states of [[Detection]] a target can be in: [[Detection|Observed]], [[Hidden]], or [[Undetected]]. Vision, hearing, and scent are three prominent senses, but each has a different degree of acuity. When one creature might detect another, the GM almost always uses the most precise sense available.  

Pathfinder's rules assume that a given creature has vision as its only precise sense and hearing as its only imprecise sense. Some characters and creatures, however, have precise or imprecise senses that don't match this assumption. For instance, a character with poor vision might treat that sense as imprecise, an animal with the [[Scent]] ability can use its sense of smell as an imprecise sense, and a creature with [[Echolocation]]  or a similar ability can use hearing as a precise sense. Such senses are often given special names and appear as “echolocation (precise),” “scent (imprecise) 30 feet,” etc.

# Detecting with Other Senses

Most abilities that designate “a creature you can see” (or the like) function just as well if the user can precisely sense the subject with a different sense. If a monster uses a sense other than vision, the GM can adapt ways of avoiding detection that work with the monster's senses. For example, a creature that has [[Echolocation]] might use hearing as a primary sense. This could mean its quarry is [[Concealed]] in a noisy chamber, [[Hidden]] in a great enough uproar, or [[Invisible]] under a silence spell.  

# Using Stealth With Other Senses

The [[Stealth]] skill is designed to use [[Hide]] for avoiding visual detection and [[Avoid Notice]] and [[Sneak]] to avoid being both seen and heard. For many special senses, a player can describe how they're avoiding detection by that special sense and use the most applicable Stealth action. For instance, a creature stepping lightly to avoid being detected via [[Tremorsense]] would be using Sneak.  

In some cases, rolling a Dexterity-based Stealth skill check to Sneak doesn't make the most sense. For example, a PC trying to avoid being detected by a creature that senses heartbeats might meditate to slow their heart rate, using Wisdom instead of Dexterity for their Stealth check. When a creature could detect you using multiple different senses, use your lowest applicable attribute modifier.

# Precise Sense

Average vision is a precise sense—a sense that can be used to perceive the world in nuanced detail. 

## Mechanical Rules

 - The only way to target a creature without having drawbacks is to use a precise sense.
 - You can usually detect a creature automatically with a precise sense making it [[Detection|Observed]]. 
	 -  It might still be [[Hidden]] or [[Undetected]] by you if it’s using [[Stealth]] or is in an environment that distorts the sense. In those cases, you have to use the [[Seek]] basic action to detect the creature. 

# Imprecise Sense

Average hearing is an imprecise sense—it can’t detect the full range of detail that a precise sense can. 

## Mechanical Rules

- At best, an imprecise sense can be used to make an [[Undetected]]  or [[Detection|Unnoticed]] creature merely [[Hidden]]—it can’t make the creature [[Detection|Observed]].   You can usually sense a creature automatically with an imprecise sense making it [[Hidden]].
	- It might still be [[Undetected]] by you if it’s using [[Stealth]] or is in an environment that distorts the sense, such as a noisy room in the case of hearing. In those cases, you have to use the [[Seek]] basic action to detect the creature. 

# Vague Sense

A character also has many vague senses—ones that can alert you that something is there but aren't useful for zeroing in on it to determine exactly what it is. The most useful of these for a typical character is the sense of smell. 

## Mechanical Rules

- At best, a vague sense can be used to detect the presence of an [[Detection|Unnoticed]] creature, making it [[Undetected]]. Even then, the vague sense isn't sufficient to make the creature [[Hidden]] or [[Detection|Observed]].
