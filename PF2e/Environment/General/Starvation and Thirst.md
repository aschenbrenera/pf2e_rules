Typically characters eat and drink enough to survive comfortably. When they can’t, they’re fatigued until they do.
## Mechanical Rules

- After a number of days without water equal to a creature’s Constitution modifier + 1, the creature takes 1d4 damage each hour that can’t be healed until it quenches its thirst.
- After the same amount of time without food, it takes 1 damage each day that can’t be healed until it eats.

## Gameplay Interaction

- Buying food and water or using [[Subsist]] is the most common way to avoid starvation and thirst.

## Cost of Living

Cost of living provides a total cost to covers room and board, dues, taxes, and other fees. You typically need to track and pay for your cost of living only during downtime. You can attempt a 'Subsistence' standard of living for free by using the Subsist activity.
