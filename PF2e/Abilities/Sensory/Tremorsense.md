Tremorsense allows a creature to feel the vibrations through a solid surface caused by movement. Tremorsense functions only if the detecting creature is on the same surface as the subject, and only if the subject is moving along (or [[Burrow|Burrowing]] through) the surface.
Presented in stat blocks as: scent (imprecise) x feet

## Mechanical Rules

- You can use vibrations as a [[Senses|Imprecise Sense]] within a range as stated in ability or stat block.
	-  At best, an imprecise sense can be used to make an [[Undetected]]  or [[Detection|Unnoticed]] creature merely [[Hidden]]—it can’t make the creature [[Detection|Observed]].   You can usually sense a creature automatically with an imprecise sense making it [[Hidden]].
		- It might still be [[Undetected]] by you if it’s using [[Stealth]] or is in an environment that distorts the sense, such as a noisy room in the case of hearing. In those cases, you have to use the [[Seek]] basic action to detect the creature. 
- It only functions if the detecting creature is on the same surface as the subject, and only if the subject is moving along (or [[Burrow|Burrowing]]] through) the surface.
