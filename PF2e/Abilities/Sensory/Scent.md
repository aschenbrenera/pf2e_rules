**Description:** Scent involves sensing creatures or objects by smell. It functions only if the creature or object being detected emits an aroma. Presented in stat blocks as 'scent (imprecise) x feet'.

## Mechanical Rules

- You can use smell as a [[Senses|Imprecise Sense]] within a range as stated in ability or stat block.
	-  At best, an imprecise sense can be used to make an [[Undetected]]  or [[Detection|Unnoticed]] creature merely [[Hidden]]—it can’t make the creature [[Detection|Observed]].   You can usually sense a creature automatically with an imprecise sense making it Hidden.
		- It might still be Undetected by you if it’s using [[Stealth]] or is in an environment that distorts the sense, such as a noisy room in the case of hearing. In those cases, you have to use the [[Seek]] basic action to detect the creature. 
- It functions only if the creature or object being detected emits an aroma.
	- If a creature emits a heavy aroma or is upwind, the GM can double or even triple the range of scent abilities used to detect that creature, and the GM can reduce the range if a creature is downwind.

## Creation Interaction
