## Physical Damage

Damage dealt by weapons, many physical hazards, and a handful of spells is collectively called physical damage. The main types of physical damage are bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. 
- **Bludgeoning** damage comes from weapons and hazards that deal blunt-force trauma, like a hit from a club or being dashed against rocks.
- **Piercing** damage is dealt from stabs and punctures, whether from a dragon's fangs or the thrust of a spear.
- **Slashing** damage is delivered by a cut, be it the swing of the sword or the blow from a scythe blades trap. 

## Energy Damage

Many spells and other magical effects deal energy damage. Energy damage is also dealt from effects in the world, such as the biting cold of a blizzard to a raging forest fire. The main types of energy damage are acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic.
- **Acid** damage can be delivered by gases, liquids, and certain solids that dissolve flesh, and sometimes harder materials.
- **Cold** damage freezes material by way of contact with chilling gases and ice.
- **Electricity** damage comes from the discharge of powerful lightning and sparks. 
- **Fire** damage burns through heat and combustion.
- **Sonic** damage assaults matter with high-frequency vibration and sound waves. Many times, you deal energy damage by casting magic spells, and doing so is often useful against creatures that have immunities or resistances to physical damage.  
  
Two special types of energy damage specifically target the living and the undead.
- **Vitality** damage harms only undead creatures, withering undead bodies and disrupting incorporeal undead. Effects with this trait heal living creatures with energy from the Forge of Creation, deal vitality energy damage to undead, or manipulate vitality energy.
- **Void** damage saps life, damaging only living creatures.  Effects with this trait heal undead creatures with void energy, deal void damage to living creatures, or manipulate void energy.
  
Powerful and pure magical energy can manifest itself as force damage. 
- **Force** damage is unlikely to be resisted—not even by incorporeal creatures such as ghosts.   Effects with this trait deal force damage or create objects made of pure magical force.

## Spirit Damage

Directly affecting the spiritual essence of a creature, spirit damage can damage a target projecting its consciousness or possessing another creature even if the target's body is elsewhere. The possessed creature isn't harmed by the blast. **Spirit** damage doesn't harm creatures that have no spirit, such as constructs. Many effects that deal spirit damage also have the sanctified, holy, or unholy trait.  Effects with this trait can affect creatures with spiritual essence and might deal spirit damage. A creature with this trait is defined by its spiritual essence. Spirit creatures often lack a material form.

## Mental Damage

Sometimes an effect can target the mind with enough psychic force to actually deal damage to the creature. When it does, it deals **Mental** damage. Mindless creatures and those with only programmed or rudimentary intelligence are often immune to mental damage and effects. A mental effect can alter the target’s mind. It has no effect on an object or a mindless creature. 

## Poison Damage

Venoms, toxins and the like can deal **Poision** damage, which affects creatures by way of contact, ingestion, inhalation, or injury. In addition to coming from monster attacks, alchemical items, and spells, poison damage is often caused by ongoing [[Afflictions]].

## Bleed Damage

Another special type of physical damage is **bleed** damage. This is [[Persistent Damage]] that represents loss of blood. As such, it has no effect on nonliving creatures or living creatures that don't need blood to live. Weaknesses and resistances to physical damage apply. Bleed damage ends automatically if you're healed to your full Hit Points.  

## Precision Damage

Sometimes you are able to make the most of your attack through sheer precision. When you hit with an ability that grants you **Precision** damage, you increase the attack's listed damage, using the same damage type, rather than tracking a separate pool of damage.
  
Some creatures are immune to precision damage, regardless of the damage type; these are often amorphous creatures that lack vulnerable anatomy. Since precision damage is always the same type of damage as the attack it's augmenting, a creature that is resistant to physical damage, like a gargoyle, would resist not only the dagger's damage but also the precision damage, even though it is not specifically resistant to precision damage.  

## Precious Materials

While not their own damage category, precious materials can modify damage to penetrate a creature's resistances or take advantage of its weaknesses.
