The more attacks you make beyond your first in a single turn, the less accurate you become. If you use an action with the `ATTACK` trait more than once on the same turn, your attacks after the first take a penalty called a multiple attack penalty. 

## Mechanical Rules

- Your second `ATTACK` action on the same turn takes a –5 penalty, and any subsequent `ATTACK` actions take a –10 penalty.
	- Every check that has the `ATTACK` trait counts toward your multiple attack penalty, including [[Strike]], [[Spell attack rolls]], and many others. 
	- If a single action allows you multiple checks that have the `ATTACK` trait, apply the multiple attack penalty to each check normally unless the action says otherwise.
- The multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to attacks you make when it isn't your turn (such as attacks made as part of a reaction).
- You can use a weapon with the [[Agile]] trait to reduce your multiple attack penalty to –4 on the second attack or –8 on further attacks. 
	- This reduction doesn't affect future attacks with non-agile weapons.

## Multiple Attack Penalty

| **Attack**           | Standard | **Agile** |
| -------------------- | -------- | --------- |
| First                | None     | None      |
| Second               | -5       | -4        |
| Third and subsequent | -10      | -8        |
