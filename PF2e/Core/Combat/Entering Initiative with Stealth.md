When members on one or both sides of an impending battle are being stealthy, you'll need to deal with the Detection impacts of Stealth on the start of the encounter.

## Mechanical Rules

- Determine the position of all participants. Anyone who is using [[Avoid Notice]] is likely in a position where they can benefit from [[Cover]], [[Detection|Concealment]], or being entirely out their enemies [[Senses|Line of Sight]]. If the participant can't be placed in this kind of position, it may not be appropriate to allow them to roll [[Stealth]] for their initiative.
	- e.g. Behind a tree trunk, in the corridor shadows, or behind a closed door outside the room the enemies are in.
- Those using Avoid Notice can attempt a Stealth check for their initiative. This check will also determine their Detection level by enemies.
	- All the normal Stealth check bonuses and penalties apply, including any bonus for having Cover.
	- To determine someone's [[Detection]] level by an enemy, compare their Stealth check for initiative to the enemy's Perception DC (as normal for [[Sneak]]).
		- **Success:** You're [[Undetected]] by the creature.  
		- **Failure:** You're [[Hidden]] from the creature.
		- **Critical Failure:** You're [[Detection|Observed]] by the creature. If you're Invisible you are Hidden instead.
	- If a creature starts their turn with all of its enemies Undetected, the GM determines if the enemies are additionally [[Detection|Unnoticed]].
		- If all of the creature's enemies are Unnoticed, the creature carries on with it's regular activities while in initiative, unaware of the enemies presence.
		- Otherwise, the creature knows someone is around and may start moving about, using [[Seek]] or otherwise preparing to fight. 
	- Those using Avoid Notice have the option to roll Perception instead, but if they do, they forsake their Stealth and are going to be Observed.
