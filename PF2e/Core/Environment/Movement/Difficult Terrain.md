**Description:** Difficult terrain is any terrain that impedes your movement, ranging from particularly rough or unstable surfaces to thick ground cover and countless other impediments. 

## Mechanical Rules

- Moving 5 feet (or a square) into difficult terrain costs an extra 5 feet of movement. This additional cost is not increased further when moving diagonally.
- You can't [[Step]] into Difficult terrain. 
- Movement you make while jumping ignores the terrain you're jumping over.

## Gameplay Interaction
- [[Fly|Flying]] upward (straight up or diagonally) uses the rules for moving through Difficult Terrain.

## Ignore Difficult Terrain

Some abilities (such as [[Fly|Flight]] or being [[Incorporeal]]) allow you to avoid the movement reduction from some types of difficult terrain. If you can ignore difficult terrain, you can also move through greater difficult terrain at the extra movement cost difficult terrain normally imposes. An ability doesn’t let you entirely ignore greater difficult terrain unless the ability specifies otherwise.

# Greater Difficult Terrain

## Mechanical Rules

- Same rules as Difficult terrain except moving 5 feet (or a square) into greater difficult terrain instead costs 10 additional feet of movement.
- An ability doesn’t let you entirely ignore greater difficult terrain unless the ability specifies otherwise.
