**Description:** An area without light.

## Mechanical Rules

 - A creature or object within darkness is [[Hidden]] or [[Undetected]] unless the seeker has [[Darkvision]] or a [[Senses|Precise Sense]] other than vision.
 - Someone without darkvision or another means of perceiving in darkness has the [[Blinded]] condition while in darkness,  though it might be able to see into illuminated areas beyond the darkness normally.
 - After being in darkness, sudden exposure to bright light might make you [[Dazzled]] for a short time, as determined by the GM.
