Often, temperature doesn't impose enough of a mechanical effect to worry about beyond describing the clothing the characters need to wear to be comfortable. Particularly hot and cold weather can make creatures fatigued more quickly during overland travel and can cause damage if harsh enough, as shown in the Temperature Effects table below.  
  
Appropriate cold-weather gear can negate the damage from severe cold or reduce the damage from extreme cold to that of particularly severe cold.

## Temperature Effects

|**Category**|**Temperature**|**Fatigue**|**Damage**|
|---|---|---|---|
|Incredible cold|-80º F or colder|2 hours|Moderate cold every minute|
|Extreme cold|-79º F to -20º F|4 hours|Minor cold every 10 minutes|
|Severe cold|-21º F to 12º F|4 hours|Minor cold every hour|
|Mild cold|13º F to 32º F|4 hours|None|
|Normal|33º F to 94º F|8 hours|None|
|Mild heat|95º F* to 104º F*|4 hours|None|
|Severe heat|105º F* to 114º F|4 hours|Minor fire every hour|
|Extreme heat|115º F to 139º F|4 hours|Minor fire every 10 minutes|
|Incredible heat|140º F or warmer|2 hours|Moderate fire every minute|

* Adjust temperatures down by 15º F in areas of high humidity
