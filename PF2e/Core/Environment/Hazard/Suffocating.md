## Mechanical Rules

- You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier.
	- Reduce your remaining air by 1 round at the end of each of your turns, or by 2 if you attacked or cast any spells that turn.
	- You also lose 1 round worth of air each time you are critically hit or critically fail a save against a damaging effect.
	- If you speak (including Casting a Spell) you lose all remaining air.  
- When you run out of air, you fall [[Unconscious]]] and start suffocating.
	- Once your access to air is restored, you stop suffocating and are no longer unconscious (unless you're at 0 Hit Points).
- You can't recover from being unconscious and must attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save at the end of each of your turns. On each check after the first, the DC increases by 5 and the damage by 1d10; these increases are cumulative. 
	- **Failure:** You take 1d10 damage.
	- **Critical Failure:** You die.
