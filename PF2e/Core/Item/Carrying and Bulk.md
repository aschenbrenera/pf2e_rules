## Carrying

A character carries items in three ways: held, worn, and stowed. 
 - **Held items** are in your hands; a character typically has two hands, allowing them to hold an item in each hand or a single two-handed item using both hands.
 - **Worn items** are tucked into pockets, belt pouches, bandoliers, weapon sheaths, and so forth, and they can be retrieved and returned relatively quickly.
 - **Stowed items** are in a backpack or a similar container, and they are more difficult to access.

### Wielding Items
Some abilities require you to wield an item, typically a weapon. You’re wielding an item any time you’re holding it in the number of hands needed to use it effectively. When wielding an item, you’re not just carrying it around—you’re ready to use it. Other abilities might require you to be wearing the item, to be holding it, or simply to have it.

### Dragging

In some situations, you might drag an object or creature rather than carry it. If you’re dragging something, treat its Bulk as half. Typically, you can drag one thing at a time, you must use both hands to do so, and you drag slowly— roughly 50 feet per minute. Use the total Bulk of what you’re dragging, for instance, if you’re dragging a sack filled with treasure, total the Bulk of everything inside.

### Drawing and Stowing Items

Drawing a worn item or changing how you're carrying an item usually requires you to use an Interact action (or sometimes the Release action). Many ways of using items require you to spend multiple actions. For example, drinking a potion worn at your belt requires using an Interact action to draw it and then using a second action to drink it as described in its Activate entry.  
  
The number of hands you need to Interact is usually clear, and if it changes during the action the action takes the maximum number of hands needed during it. The GM decides if it's unclear. 
You can draw, pick up, or hold an item that needs two hands using only one hand, but you need to subsequently change your grip to hold it in two hands if you want to wield or use it.

## Bulk

Carrying especially heavy or unwieldy items can make it more difficult for you to move, as can overloading yourself with too much gear. The Bulk value of an item reflects how difficult the item is to handle, representing its size, weight, and general awkwardness. If you have a high Strength modifier, you usually don’t need to worry about Bulk unless you’re carrying numerous substantial items.

### Bulk Limit

You can carry an amount of Bulk equal to 5 plus your Strength modifier without penalty; if you carry more, you gain the [[Encumbered]] condition. You can’t hold or carry more Bulk than 10 plus your Strength modifier.

### Bulk Values

Items can have a number to indicate their Bulk value, or they can be light (indicated by an L) or negligible (indicated by a —) for the purpose of determining Bulk. For instance, full plate armor is 4 Bulk, a longsword is 1 Bulk, a dagger or scroll is light, and a piece of chalk is negligible. Ten light items count as 1 Bulk, and you round down fractions (so 9 light items count as 0 Bulk, and 11 light items count as 1 Bulk). Items of negligible Bulk don’t count toward Bulk unless you try to carry vast numbers of them, as determined by the GM.
