Depending on how the GM tracks movement, you move in feet or miles based on your character’s Speed with the relevant movement type. Typical rates are on the table below.
  
The rates in the table assume traveling over flat and clear terrain at a determined pace, but one that’s not exhausting. 

- Moving through [[Difficult terrain]] halves the listed movement rate. Greater difficult terrain reduces the distance traveled to one-third the listed amount. 
- If the travel requires a skill check to accomplish, such as [[Climb|Climbing]] or [[Swim|Swimming]], the GM might call for a check once per hour using the result and the table above to determine your progress.
