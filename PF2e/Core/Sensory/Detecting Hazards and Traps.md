Every hazard has a trigger of some kind that sets its dangers in motion. For traps, this could be a mechanism like a trip wire or a pressure plate, while for an environmental hazard or haunt, the trigger may simply be proximity. When characters approach a hazard, they have a chance of finding the trigger area or mechanism before triggering the hazard. They automatically receive a check to detect hazards unless the hazards require a minimum proficiency rank to do so.  
  
- During exploration, determine whether the party detects a hazard when the PCs first enter the general area in which it appears.
- If the hazard doesn't list a minimum proficiency rank, roll a secret Perception check against the hazard's Stealth DC for each PC.
- For hazards with a minimum proficiency rank, roll only if someone is actively searching (using the [[Search]] activity while exploring or the [[Seek]] action in an encounter), and only if they have the listed proficiency rank or higher. Anyone who succeeds becomes aware of the hazard, and you can describe what they notice.  
- Magical hazards that don't have a minimum proficiency rank can be found using detect magic, but this spell doesn't provide enough information to understand or disable the hazard, it only reveals the hazard's presence.
- Magical hazards with a minimum proficiency rank cannot be found with detect magic at all.
- Determining a magical hazard's properties thoroughly enough to disable it requires either the use of more powerful magic that detect magic or a successful skill check, likely using Identify Magic or Recall Knowledge.
