When members on one or both sides of an impending battle are being stealthy, you'll need to deal with the [[Detection]] impacts of Stealth on the start of the encounter.

- Anyone who is using [[Avoid Notice]] can attempt a Stealth check for their initiative.
	- All the normal bonuses and penalties apply, including any bonus for having [[Cover]].
	- You can give them the option to roll Perception instead, but if they do, they forsake their Stealth and are definitely going to be detected.  
- To determine whether someone is [[Undetected]] by other participants in the encounter, you still compare their Stealth check for initiative to the Perception DC of their enemies. They're Undetected by anyone whose DC they meet or exceed.
- If a creature starts their turn with all enemies Undetected, the GM determines if the enemies are also [[Detection|Unnoticed]].
	- If all of the creature's enemies are Unnoticed, the creature carries on with it's regular activities while in initiative, unaware of the enemies presence.
	- Otherwise, the creature knows someone is around and may start moving about, using [[Seek]] or otherwise preparing to fight.
