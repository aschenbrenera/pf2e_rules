When an effect forces you to move, the distance you move is defined by the effect that moved you. Some common causes of forced movement include the [[Reposition]] and [[Shove]] actions. Usually the creature or effect forcing the movement chooses the path the victim takes. 

- Forced movement doesn't trigger reactions that are triggered by movement. 
- If forced movement would move you into a space you can't occupy—because objects are in the way or because you lack the movement type needed to reach it, for example—you stop moving in the last space you can occupy.  
- Some abilities allow a creature to move while carrying another along with it. This is forced movement for the carried creature. Unless noted otherwise, they both move on the same path while this happens—the carrying creature can't drag its victim through dangers while avoiding them itself.
- In the rare cases where it's unclear whether your movement is voluntary or forced, the GM makes the determination.
