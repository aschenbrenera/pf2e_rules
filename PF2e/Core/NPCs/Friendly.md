**Description:** Has a good attitude toward you, but won't necessarily stick their neck out to help you.
## Mechanical Rules

- This condition reflects a creature's disposition toward a particular character, and only supernatural effects (like a spell) can impose this condition on a PC.
- A creature that is friendly to a character likes that character.
	- It is likely to agree to a [[Request]] from that character as long as they are simple, safe, and don't cost too much to fulfill.
	- If the character (or one of their allies) uses [hostile actions](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=300) against the creature, the creature gains a worse attitude condition depending on the severity of the hostile action, as determined by the GM.
