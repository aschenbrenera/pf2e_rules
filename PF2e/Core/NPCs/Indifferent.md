**Description:** Doesn't care about you either way. (Most NPCs start out indifferent.)
## Mechanical Rules

- This condition reflects a creature's disposition toward a particular character, and only supernatural effects (like a spell) can impose this condition on a PC.
- A creature that is indifferent to a character doesn't really care one way or the other about that character.
- Assume a creature's attitude to a given character is indifferent unless specified otherwise.
