# Identifying a Spell

Sometimes you need to identify a spell, especially if its effects aren't obvious right away. You typically notice a spell being cast due to its sensory spell manifestations. 

## Mechanical Rules

- If you notice a spell being cast, and you have that spell in your repertoire or prepared it that day (even if you already cast it), you automatically know what the spell is, including the rank to which it is heightened.  
- If you notice a spell being cast, but don't have it prepared or in your repertoire, you must spend an action on your turn attempting to identify it using [[Recall Knowledge]].
	- If you don't have the advantage of watching the spell being cast, it requires using [[Identify Magic]] exploration activity instead of Recall Knowledge.
	- In either case the DC for success is usually equal to Spell Rank DC + Rarity Adjustment. 

# Identification and Learning DCs

The DC to Identify Magic, [[Identify Alchemy]], [[Learn Spell]], or Identify a Spell with Recall Knowledge is usually the DC listed for the spell’s rank or the item’s level, adjusted for its rarity.
DC = (Spell Rank DC or Item Level DC) + (Rarity or Difficulty Adjustment)

A very strange item or phenomenon usually uses a higher DC adjustment.
For a cursed item or certain illusory items, you can use an incredibly hard DC to increase the chance of misidentification.
