You invest your energy in an item with the `INVESTED` trait as you don it. 

## Mechanical Rules

- A character can invest only 10 magical items that have the `INVESTED` trait.
	- None of the magical effects of the `INVESTED` item apply if the character hasn’t invested it, nor can it be activated, though the character still gains any normal benefits from wearing the physical item (like a hat keeping rain off their head).
- This process requires 1 or more [[Interact]] actions, usually taking the same amount of time it takes to don the item. 
- Once you’ve Invested the Item, you benefit from its constant magical abilities as long as you meet its other requirements (for most invested items, the only other requirement is that you must be wearing the item). This investiture lasts until you remove the item.  
	- The item still counts against your daily limit after it loses its investiture.
- You reset the limit during your [[Rest|Daily Preparations]], at which point you Invest your Items anew.
- If you’re still wearing items you had invested the previous day, you can typically keep them invested on the new day, but they still count against your limit.
