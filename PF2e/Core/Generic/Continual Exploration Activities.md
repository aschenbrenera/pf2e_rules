Continual Exploration activities that happen continually as the group explores are meant to be narrative first and foremost, with the player describing to you what they're doing, and then the GM determining which activity applies and describing any details or alterations for the situation.

If a player says, “I'm Avoiding Notice,” they should add more detail, like what precautions they're taking. Likewise, if a player says they're looking for traps and keeping their shield raised and covering the group's tracks, they should say which of these they are prioritizing to narrow down the activity.

This does not apply for exploration activities that are discrete and occur when the group is taking a pause or zooming in on a particular action, such as Treat Wounds. Characters can always drop out of a continual exploration activity to perform a discrete one (even if they are fatigued and can't sustain an exploration activity as they travel), and they can change activities at any time.
