You're at your best when you take time to rest and prepare. 

## Mechanical Rules

- Once every 24 hours, you can take a period of rest (typically 8 hours), during which you heal naturally.
	- Regain Hit Points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1) times your level
	- You might recover from or improve certain conditions.
	- Sleeping in armor results in poor rest that leaves you [[Fatigued]].
- After you rest, you make your daily preparations, which takes around 1 hour. You can prepare only if you've rested, and only once per day. 
- If you go more than 16 hours without resting, you become fatigued (you can't recover from this fatigue until you rest at least 8 continuous hours).  

# Daily Preparations

Just before setting out to explore, or after a night's rest, the PCs spend time to prepare for the adventuring day. This typically happens over the span of 30 minutes to an hour in the morning, but only after 8 full hours of rest.

## Mechanical Rules

- You can prepare only if you've rested, and only once per day. 
- Spellcasters regain spell slots, and prepared spellcasters choose spells to have available that day.
- [[Focus Spells|Focus Points]] and other abilities and items that reset during daily preparations refresh. This includes abilities that can be used only a certain number of times per day.
- You don armor and equip weapons and other gear.
- You [[Invest]] up to 10 worn magic items to gain their benefits for the day.


## Gameplay Interaction

- Each time you get a full night's rest, your [[Drained]] value decreases by 1.
