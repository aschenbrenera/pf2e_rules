Three conditions measure the degree to which you can sense a creature or object: Observed, [[Hidden]], and [[Undetected]]. However, the [[Concealed]] and [[Invisible]] conditions can partially mask a creature, and the Unnoticed condition indicates you have no idea a creature is around.  
  
With the exception of invisible, all of these conditions are relative to the viewer—it's possible for a creature to be observed to you but hidden from your ally. Most of these rules apply to objects as well as creatures.  
  
Typically, the GM tracks how well creatures detect each other, since neither party has perfect information. For example, you might think a creature is in the last place you sensed it, but it was able to [[Sneak]] away. Or you might think a creature can't see you in the dark, but it has [[Darkvision]].
  
You can attempt to avoid detection by using the [[Stealth]] skill to [[Avoid Notice]], [[Hide]], or [[Sneak]], or by using the [[Deception]] skill to [[Create a Diversion]].

## Observed

In most circumstances, you can sense creatures without difficulty and target them normally. Creatures in this state are observed. Observing requires a [[Senses|Precise Sense]] which for most creatures means sight. If you can’t observe the creature, it’s either [[Hidden]], [[Undetected]], or [[Detection|Unnoticed]] and you’ll need to factor in the targeting restrictions. Even if a creature is observed, it might still be [[Concealed]].

## [[Hidden]]

A creature that's hidden is only barely perceptible. You know what space it occupies, but little else. Perhaps the creature just moved behind cover and successfully used the [[Hide]] action.  Maybe you've been [[Blinded]] or the creature is [[Invisible]], but you used the [[Seek]] basic action to determine its general location based on hearing alone. 

## [[Undetected]]

If a creature is undetected, you don't know what space it occupies, and you can't easily target it. Using the [[Seek]] basic action can help you find an undetected creature, usually making it [[Hidden]] from you instead of undetected. If a creature is undetected, that doesn't necessarily mean you're unaware of its presence—you might suspect an undetected creature is in the room with you, even though you're unable to find its space.  

## Unnoticed

If you have no idea a creature is even present, that creature is unnoticed by you. A creature that is [[Undetected]] might also be unnoticed. This condition usually matters for abilities that can be used only against targets totally unaware of your presence.
