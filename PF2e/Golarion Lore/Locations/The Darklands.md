Beneath all of the surface lands, carved into the planet's very crust, lie the twisting tunnels of the tripartite underground realm known collectively as the **Darklands**, which houses great horrors and dangers but equally great opportunities for triumph and treasure. Deep beneath the surface lies the region known as **Nar-Voth**, a land of tortuous interconnected cave systems. Dwarves and orcs once lived here, until they moved to the surface after Earthfall—now it's ruled by those who remained and thrive in the dark, such as xulgaths and calignis.  
  
**Sekamina**, once a seat of power for the Serpentfolk Empire in prehistoric times, is found below Nar-Voth. The caverns here are much larger than any above, some seeming to span entire continents. The ghoul city of **Nemret Noktoria** can also be found here, deep underneath the surface nations of Osirion and Thuvia. Stranger and awful beings, such as the bizarre **seugathi** and the nightmarish **gogiteth**, creep upward from deeper in the Darklands, ensuring the region remains poorly explored.  
  
The deepest layers of the Darklands are known as **Orv**. Rumors trickle upwards of massive vaults that contain fantastical biomes, built by powerful alien beings for unknown purposes—but few explorers can brave the dangers of the Darklands long enough to return with the truth.
