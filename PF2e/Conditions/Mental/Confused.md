**Description:** You don't have your wits about you, and you attack wildly.

## Mechanical Rules

- You don't treat anyone as allies.  
- You can't [[Delay]] or use reactions.  
- You use all your actions to Strike, cast offensive cantrips, or actions  used to facilitate attack.
- If it's impossible for you to attack or cast spells, you babble incoherently, you waste all actions.
- You attack a target randomly determined by the GM.  
	- If you have no other viable targets, you target yourself, automatically hitting but not scoring a critical hit.
- Each time you take damage from an attack or spell, you can attempt a DC 11 flat check to recover from your confusion and end the condition.
- Inherit [[Off-Guard]].
	- You take a â€“2 circumstance penalty to AC.
