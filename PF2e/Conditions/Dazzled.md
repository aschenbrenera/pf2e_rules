## Mechanical Rules

- If vision is your only precise sense, all creatures and objects are [[Concealed]] from you.  
	- *Concealed*: A creature that you're concealed from must succeed at a DC 5 flat check when targeting you with an attack, spell, or other effect.  
		- If the check fails, you aren't affected.  
		- Area effects aren't subject to this flat check.
