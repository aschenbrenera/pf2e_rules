**Description:** You feel ill. Sickened always includes a value. 
## Mechanical Rules

- You take a status penalty equal to your sickened value on all your checks and DCs.
- You can't willingly ingest anything while sickened.  
- You can spend a single action retching in an attempt to recover, which lets you immediately attempt a Fortitude save against the DC of the effect that made you sickened. On a success, you reduce your sickened value by 1 (or by 2 on a critical success).
