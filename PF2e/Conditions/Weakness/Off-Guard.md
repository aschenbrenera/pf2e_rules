## Gameplay Interactions

- Some effects give you the off-guard condition only to certain creatures or against certain attacks. Others—especially conditions—can make you off-guard against everything. If a rule doesn't specify that the condition applies only to certain circumstances, it applies to all of them, such as “The target is off-guard.”
