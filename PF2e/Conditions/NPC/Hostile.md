**Description:** Actively works against you—and might attack you just because of their dislike.
## Mechanical Rules

- This condition reflects a creature's disposition toward a particular character, and only supernatural effects (like a spell) can impose on a PC.
- A creature hostile to a character actively seeks to harm that character. It doesn't necessarily attack, but it won't accept a [[Request]] from the character.
