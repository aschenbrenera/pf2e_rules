**Description:** You can't hear. 

## Mechanical Rules

- You automatically critically fail Perception checks that require you to be able to hear.
- You take a –2 status penalty to Perception checks for initiative and checks that involve sound but also rely on other senses.
- If you perform an action that has the `AUDITORY` trait, you must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the action is lost; attempt the check after spending the action but before any effects are applied.
- You are immune to auditory effects.
