**Description:** When you are undetected by someone, they can't see you at all, have no idea what space you occupy, and can't target you (directly), though you still can be affected by abilities that target an area. 

## Mechanical Rules

- Someone you're undetected from must succeed at a secret DC 11 flat check when targeting you with an attack, spell, or other effect or it fails to affect you.  
	- The flat check and attack roll are rolled in secret by the GM, who doesn't reveal whether the attack missed due to failing the flat check, failing the attack roll, or choosing the wrong square.  
- A creature you're undetected from is [[Off-Guard]] to you.  
	- They take a –2 circumstance penalty to AC to you.

## Gameplay Interactions

-  Someone successfully using [[Seek]] against you while you're Undetected to them makes you [[Hidden]] to them instead.
	- If you are Undetected because you are [[Invisible]], use those rules instead.

## Gameplay Tips

- This condition is usually not static. It's a relative condition between two creatures or objects.
