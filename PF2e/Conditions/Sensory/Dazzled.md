**Description:** Your eyes are overstimulated or your vision is swimming.

## Mechanical Rules

- If vision is your only precise sense, all creatures and objects are [[Concealed]] from you.  
	-You must succeed at a DC 5 flat check when targeting someone that is concealed from you with an attack, spell, or other effect.  
		- If the check fails, the target isn't affected.  
		- Area effects aren't subject to this flat check.

## Inheritance Sources

-  After being in [[Darkness]], sudden exposure to bright light might make youÂ Dazzled for a short time, as determined by the GM.
