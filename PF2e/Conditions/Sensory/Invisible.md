**Description:** You can't be seen. 

## Mechanical Rules

- You can't be seen (visually).
- Depending on circumstance you usually either [[Undetected]] or [[Hidden]] from creatures. 
	- Someone you're hidden or undetected from must succeed at a DC 11 flat check when targeting you with an attack, spell, or other effect or it fails to affect you.  
		- Area effects aren't subject to this flat check. 
		- If you are Undetected, the flat check and attack roll are rolled in secret by the GM, who doesn't reveal whether the attack missed due to failing the flat check, failing the attack roll, or choosing the wrong square.  
	- Someone you're hidden or undetected from is [[Off-Guard]] to you.  
			- They take a –2 circumstance penalty to AC specific to you.

## Gameplay Interactions

-  By default an invisible creature is Undetected to someone except for the following:
	- If you become invisible while observed by someone, you start out Hidden to them.
	- You are still [[Detection|Observed]] to someone who has a  [[Senses|Precise Sense]] other than vision or a similar magical ability.
	- You are Hidden to someone who successfully uses the [[Seek]] action on you.
	- Other effects might partially foil invisibility. Examples include:
		- If you were tracking an invisible creature's footprints through the snow, the footprints would make it Hidden.
		- Throwing a net over an invisible creature would make it Observed but [[Concealed]] for as long as the net is on it.
- Successfully using [[Sneak]] against creatures makes you Undetected to them.
