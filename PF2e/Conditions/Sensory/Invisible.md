**Description:** You can't be seen. 

## Mechanical Rules

- You can't be seen (visually).
- By default an invisible creature is [[Undetected]] to someone except for the following:
	- If you become invisible while observed by someone, you start out [[Hidden]] to them.
	- You are still [[Detection|Observed]] to someone who has a  [[Senses|Precise Sense]] other than vision or a similar magical ability.
	- You are Hidden to someone who successfully uses the [[Seek]] action on you.
	- Other effects might partially foil invisibility. Examples include:
		- If you were tracking an invisible creature's footprints through the snow, the footprints would make it Hidden.
		- Throwing a net over an invisible creature would make it Observed but [[Concealed]] for as long as the net is on it.
- 

## Gameplay Interactions

-  Successfully using [[Sneak]] against creatures make you [[Undetected]] to them.
