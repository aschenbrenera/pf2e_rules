**Description:** You're compelled to focus your attention on something, distracting you from whatever else is going on around you. 

## Mechanical Rules

- You take a –2 status penalty to Perception and skill checks
- You can't use `CONCENTRATE` actions unless they (or their intended consequences) are related to the subject of your fascination, as determined by the GM. 
- This condition ends if a creature uses hostile actions against you or any of your allies.
