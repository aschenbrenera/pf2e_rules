**Description:** While you're hidden from someone, that creature knows the space you're in but can't tell precisely where you are. 

## Mechanical Rules

- Someone you're hidden from must succeed at a DC 11 flat check when targeting you with an attack, spell, or other effect or it fails to affect you.  
	- Area effects aren't subject to this flat check. 
- Someone you're hidden from is [[Off-Guard]] to you.  
	- They take a â€“2 circumstance penalty to AC specific to you.

## Gameplay Interactions

- Someone successfully using [[Seek]]  with a [[Senses|Precise Sense]] against you while you're [[Hidden]] to them makes you [[Detection|Observed]] to them instead.

## Gameplay Tips

- This condition is usually not static. It's a relative condition between two creatures or objects.
