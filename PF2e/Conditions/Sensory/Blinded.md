**Description:** You can't see.

## Mechanical Rules

- Your vision doesn't work.
	- You are immune to visual effects.  
	- You automatically critically fail perception checks that rely only on vision.  
- If vision is your only precise sense, -4 to all other perception checks.  (e.g. Seek and Initiative)
- Normal terrain is [[Difficult terrain]] to you. 
- Blinded overrides Dazzled.

## Inheritance Sources
