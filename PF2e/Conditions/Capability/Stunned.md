**Description:** You've become senseless. Stunned either includes a value or a duration.

## Mechanical Rules

- Stunned overridesÂ [[Slowed]].
	- If your stunned condition ends while you are slowed, you count the actions lost to the stunned condition toward those lost to being slowed.
- You can't act.
- If you have a Stunned value, it indicates how many total actions you lose, possibly over multiple turns. 
	- Each time you regain actions, reduce the number you regain by your stunned value, then reduce your stunned value by the number of actions you lost. 
-  If you have a Stunned duration, lose all your actions for the duration.
