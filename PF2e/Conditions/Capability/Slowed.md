**Description:** Slowed always includes a value. You have fewer actions based on that value.

## Mechanical Rules

- When you regain your actions, reduce the number of actions regained by your slowed value.
- Because you regain actions at the start of your turn, you don't immediately lose actions if you become slowed during your turn.
