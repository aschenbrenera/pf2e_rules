 **Description:** You're sleeping or have been knocked out. 
## Mechanical Rules

-  Inherit [[Blinded]] & [[Off-Guard]]
	- Your vision doesn't work. 
		- You are immune to visual effects.  
		- You automatically critically fail perception checks that rely only on vision.
- -6 penalty to AC (-4 status penalty and -2 circumstance penalty)
- -4 status penalty to Perception and Reflex Saves.

## Gameplay Interactions

- If you are dying and you are restored to 1 Hit Point or more, you lose the dying and unconscious conditions and can act normally on your next turn. 
- If at 0 hit points but not dying, the GM determines how long (typically 10 min) before you gain 1 HP and wake up.  
- If you have 1  or more Hit Points (typically because you are asleep or unconscious due to an effect), you wake up in one of the following ways.
	- You take damage, though if the damage reduces you to 0 Hit Points, you remain unconscious and gain the dying condition as normal.
	- You receive healing, other than the natural healing you get from resting.
	- Someone shakes you awake with an Interact action.
	- Loud noise around you might wake you. At the start of your turn, you automatically attempt a Perception check against the noise's DC (or the lowest DC if there is more than one noise), waking up if you succeed. If creatures are attempting to stay quiet around you, this Perception check uses their Stealth DCs. Some effects make you sleep so deeply that they don't allow you this Perception check.
	- If you are simply asleep, the GM decides you wake up either because you have had a restful night's sleep or something disrupted that rest.
