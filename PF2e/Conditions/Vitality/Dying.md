**Description:** You are bleeding out or otherwise at death's door. Dying always includes a value.

## Mechanical Rules

- Inherit [[Unconscious]], [[Blinded]], and [[Off-Guard]].
	- You can't take actions.
	- You fall [[Prone]] and drop items.
	- Your vision doesn't work. 
		- You are immune to visual effects.  
		- You automatically critically fail perception checks that rely only on vision.
	- -6 penalty to AC (-4 status penalty and -2 circumstance penalty)
	- -4 status penalty to Perception and Reflex Saves. 
- If you reach dying 4, you die instantly.
- Your dying condition increases by 1 if you take damage, or by 2 if you take damage from an enemy's critical hit or a critical failure on your save.
- You must attempt a recovery check at the start of your turn each round. This is a flat check with a DC equal to 10 + your current dying value.
	- **Critical Success:** Your dying value is reduced by 2. 
	- **Success:** Your dying value is reduced by 1. 
	- **Failure:** Your dying value increases by 1. 
	- **Critical Failure:** Your dying value increases by 2.

## Gameplay Interactions

- When you're reduced to 0 Hit Points, you're knocked out with the following effects:
	- Move your initiative position to directly before the current turn.
	- Gain the dying 1 condition. If the effect that knocked you out was a critical success from the attacker or the result of your critical failure, you gain the dying 2 condition instead.
		- Increase your dying value by an amount equal to your wounded value. 
		- If the damage was dealt by a nonlethal attack or nonlethal effect, you don't gain the dying condition; you're instead unconscious with 0 Hit Points.
- Any time you lose the dying condition, you gain the [[Wounded]] condition, or increase your Wounded condition value by 1 if you already have that condition.
-  You lose the dying condition automatically and wake up if you ever have 1 Hit Point or more.
- You lose the dying condition if it ever reaches dying 0. If you're still at 0 Hit Points, you remain unconscious, but you can wake up as described in that condition.
- If you have at least 1 [[Hero Point]], you can spend all of your remaining Hero Points at the start of your turn or when your dying value would increase. You lose the dying condition entirely and stabilize with 0 Hit Points. You don’t gain the wounded condition or increase its value from losing the dying condition in this way, but if you already had that condition, you don’t lose it or decrease its value.
