 **Description:** Your soul has been gripped by a powerful force that calls you closer to death. Doomed always includes a value. 
 
## Mechanical Rules

- The [[Dying]] value at which you die is reduced by your doomed value.
- If your maximum dying value is reduced to 0, you instantly die.
- When you die, you're no longer doomed.  
- Your doomed value decreases by 1 each time you get a full night's rest.
