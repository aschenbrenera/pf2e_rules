**Description:** You have been seriously injured. Wounded always includes a value.

## Mechanical Rules

-  If you gain the [[Dying]] condition while wounded, increase your dying condition value by your wounded value.  

## Gameplay Interaction

- If you lose the dying condition and do not already have the wounded condition, you become wounded 1. If you already have the wounded condition when you lose the dying condition, your wounded condition value increases by 1. 
- Anytime you lose the Dying condition, you become wounded 1 if you didn’t already have the wounded condition. If you already have the wounded condition, your wounded condition value instead increases by 1.  
- The wounded condition ends if someone successfully restores Hit Points to you with [[Treat Wounds]], or if you are restored to full Hit Points and rest for 10 minutes.
