**Description:** Your health and vitality have been depleted as you've lost blood, life force, or some other essence. Drained always includes a value.

## Mechanical Rules

- You take a status penalty equal to your drained value on Constitution-based checks, such as Fortitude saves.
- You also lose a number of Hit Points equal to your level (minimum 1) times the drained value, and your maximum Hit Points are reduced by the same amount. 
	- Losing these Hit Points doesn't count as taking damage.  
- Each time you get a full night's [[Rest]], your drained value decreases by 1. This increases your maximum Hit Points, but you don't immediately recover the lost Hit Points.
