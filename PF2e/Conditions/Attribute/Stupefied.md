**Description:** Your thoughts and instincts are clouded. Stupefied always includes a value. 

## Mechanical Rules

- Any time you attempt to Cast a Spell, the spell is disrupted unless you succeed at a flat check with a DC equal to 5 + your stupefied value.
- You take a status penalty equal to your stupefied value on Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based checks and DCs, including;
	- Will saving throws
	- Spell attack modifiers
	- Spell DCs
	- Perception Checks
	- Intelligence Skill Checks ([[Arcana]], [[Crafting]], [[Lore]], [[Occultism]], [[Society]])
	- Charisma Skill Checks ([[Deception]], [[Diplomacy]], [[Intimidation]], [[Performance]])
	- Wisdom Skill Checks ([[Medicine]], [[Nature]], [[Religion]], [[Survival]])
