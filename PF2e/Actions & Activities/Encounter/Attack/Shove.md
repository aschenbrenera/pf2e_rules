**Traits:** `ATTACK`
**Skill:** [[Athletics]]
**Requirements:** You have at least one hand free. The target can't be more than one size larger than you.
**Description:** You push a creature away from you.

## Mechanical Rules

- Movement from this action is [[Forced Movement]]
- Attempt an [[Athletics]] check against the target's Fortitude DC.  
	- **Critical Success:** You push your target up to 10 feet away from you. You can [[Stride]] after it, but you must move the same distance and in the same direction.  
	- **Success:** You push your target back 5 feet. You can Stride after it, but you must move the same distance and in the same direction.  
	- **Critical Failure:** You lose your balance, fall, and land [[Prone]].

## Gameplay Interaction

- Forced movement doesn't trigger reactions that are triggered by movement. 
- If forced movement would move you into a space you can't occupy—because objects are in the way or because you lack the movement type needed to reach it, for example—you stop moving in the last space you can occupy.
