**Actions:** [1] ⬥
**Traits:** `ATTACK`
**Skill:** [[Athletics]]
**Description:** Using your body, a lever, or some other tool, you attempt to forcefully open a door, window, container or heavy gate.

## Mechanical Rules

- With a high enough result, you can even smash through walls. Without a [[Crowbar]], prying something open takes a –2 item penalty to the [[Athletics]] check to Force Open.
	- **Critical Success:** You open the door, window, container, or gate and can avoid damaging it in the process. 
	- **Success:** You break the door, window, container, or gate open, and it gains the [[Broken]] condition. If it's especially sturdy, the GM might have it take damage but not be broken.
	- **Critical Failure:** Your attempt jams the door, window, container, or gate shut, imposing a –2 circumstance penalty on future attempts to Force it Open.
