**Actions:** [1] ⬥
**Traits:** `ATTACK`
**Skill:** [[Athletics]]
**Requirements:** You have at least one hand free. The target can't be more than one size larger than you. You are trained in Athletics.
**Description:** You try to knock an item out of a creature's grasp.

## Mechanical Rules

- Attempt an [[Athletics]] check against the target's Reflex DC.  
	- **Critical Success:** You knock the item out of the target's grasp. It falls to the ground in the target's space.  
	- **Success:** You weaken your target's grasp on the item. Further attempts to Disarm the target of that item gain a +2 circumstance bonus, and the target takes a –2 circumstance penalty to attacks with the item or other checks requiring a firm grasp on the item. The creature can end the effect by Interacting to change its grip on the item; otherwise, it lasts as long as the creature holds the item.  
	- **Critical Failure:** You lose your balance and become [[Off-Guard]] until the start of your next turn.
