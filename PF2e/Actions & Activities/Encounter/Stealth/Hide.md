**Actions:** [1] ⬥
**Traits:** `SECRET`
**Skill:** [[Stealth]]
**Description:**

## Mechanical Rules

- You huddle behind [[Cover]] or deeper into [[Detection|Concealment]]  to become [[Hidden]] rather than [[Detection|Observed]].
- The GM rolls your [[Stealth]] check in secret and compares the result to the Perception DC of each creature you're observed by but that you have cover or greater cover against or are concealed from.
	- You get a +2 circumstance bonus to your check if you have standard cover (or +4 from greater cover).  
	- **Success:** If the creature could see you, you're now hidden from it instead of observed. If you were hidden from or [[Undetected]] by the creature, you retain that condition.  
- If you successfully become Hidden to a creature, you become Observed again any of the following occurs:
	- You cease to have cover against the creature or be Concealed from it.
	- If you do anything except Hide, [[Sneak]], or Step. The GM might allow you to perform a particularly unobtrusive action without being noticed, possibly requiring another Stealth check.  
	- You speak or make a deliberate loud noise. 
	- If you attempt to [[Strike]] a creature, the creature remains [[Off-Guard]] against that attack, and you then become observed. If you do anything else, you become observed just before you act unless the GM determines otherwise. 
	- A creature successfully uses [[Seek]] to make you observed by it. You must successfully Hide to become Hidden from it again.
