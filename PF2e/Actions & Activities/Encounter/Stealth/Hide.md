**Actions:** [1] ⬥
**Traits:** `SECRET`
**Skill:** [[Stealth]]
**Description:** You huddle behind cover or blend deeper into concealment attempting to vanish.

## Mechanical Rules

- If you are not currently benefiting from [[Cover]] or [[Concealed]], you typically would immediately fail the Stealth check.
- You get a +2 circumstance bonus to your check if you have standard cover (or +4 from greater cover).
- The GM rolls your [[Stealth]] check in secret and compares the result to the Perception DC of each creature you're observed by but that you have cover or greater cover against or are concealed from.
	- **Success:** If the creature could see you, you're now [[Hidden]] from it instead of observed. If you were hidden from or [[Undetected]] by the creature, you retain that condition.  
- If this action makes you Hidden to a creature, you become [[Detection|Observed]] by it again if any of the following occurs:
	- If at any time except during the stride of a [[Sneak]] action, you cease to have Cover against the creature and are not Concealed from it.
	- You speak or make a deliberate loud noise. 
	- A creature successfully uses [[Seek]] to make you Observed by it.
	- You attempt to Strike a creature. The creature remains [[Off-Guard]] against that attack, and you then become Observed.
	- If you do anything else except Hide, Sneak, or Step.
		- The GM might allow you to perform a particularly unobtrusive action without being noticed, possibly requiring another Stealth check.
		- You become observed just before you act unless the GM determines otherwise.
