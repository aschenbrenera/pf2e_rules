Actions:** [1] ⬥
**Traits:** `MOVE` `SECRET`
**Skill:** [[Stealth]]
**Description:** You attempt to move to another place while becoming or staying [[Undetected]].

## Mechanical Rules

- Stride up to half your Speed. (You can use Sneak while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type; you must move at half that Speed.)  
	- If you have [[Cover]] from the creature throughout your Stride, you gain the +2 circumstance bonus from cover (or +4 from greater cover) to your Stealth check. Because you're moving, the bonus increase from Taking Cover doesn't apply.
- You don't get to Sneak against a creature if, at the end of your movement, you neither are [[Concealed]] from it nor have Cover against it. You automatically become observed by such a creature.
- At the end of your movement, the GM rolls your [[Stealth]] check in secret and compares the result to the Perception DC of each creature you were [[Hidden]] from or [[Undetected]] by at the start of your movement.
	- **Success:** You're undetected by the creature during your movement and remain undetected by the creature at the end of it.  
	- **Failure:** A telltale sound or other sign gives your position away, though you still remain unseen. You're hidden from the creature throughout your movement and remain so.  
	- **Critical Failure:** You're spotted! You're observed by the creature throughout your movement and remain so. If you're [[Invisible]] and were hidden from the creature, instead of being observed you're hidden throughout your movement and remain so.
- If this action makes you Hidden or Undetected to a creature, you become [[Detection|Observed]] by it again if any of the following occurs:
	- If at any time except during the stride of a Sneak action, you cease to have Cover against the creature and are not Concealed from it.
	- You speak or make a deliberate loud noise. 
	- A creature successfully uses [[Seek]] to make you Observed by it.
	- You attempt to Strike a creature. The creature remains [[Off-Guard]] against that attack, and you then become Observed.
	- If you do anything else except [[Hide]], Sneak, or Step.
		- The GM might allow you to perform a particularly unobtrusive action without being noticed, possibly requiring another Stealth check.
		- You become observed just before you act unless the GM determines otherwise.
