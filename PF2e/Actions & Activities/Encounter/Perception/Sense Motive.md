**Actions:** [1] ⬥
**Traits:** `CONCENTRATE` `SECRET`
**Description:** You try to tell whether a creature's behavior is abnormal. 

## Mechanical Rules

- Choose one creature and assess it for odd body language, signs of nervousness, and other indicators that it might be trying to deceive someone.
- You typically can't try to Sense the Motive of the same creature again until the situation changes significantly.  
- The GM attempts a single secret Perception check for you and compares the result to the [[Deception]] DC of the creature, the DC of a spell affecting the creature's mental state, or another appropriate DC determined by the GM.
	- **Critical Success:** You determine the creature's true intentions and get a solid idea of any mental magic affecting it.  
	- **Success:** You can tell whether the creature is behaving normally, but you don't know its exact intentions or what magic might be affecting it.  
	- **Failure:** You detect what a deceptive creature wants you to believe. If they're not being deceptive, you believe they're behaving normally.  
	- **Critical Failure:** You get a false sense of the creature's intentions.
