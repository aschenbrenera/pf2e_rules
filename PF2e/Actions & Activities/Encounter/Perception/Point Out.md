**Actions:** [1] ⬥
**Traits:** `AUDITORY` `MANIPULATE` `VISUAL`
**Description:** A creature is [[Undetected]] by one or more of your allies but isn't undetected by you.

## Mechanical Rules

- You indicate a creature that you can see to one or more allies, gesturing in a direction and describing the distance verbally.
- That creature is [[Hidden]] to your allies, rather than undetected.
- This works only for allies who can see you and are in a position where they could potentially detect the target.
