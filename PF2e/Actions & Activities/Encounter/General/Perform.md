- Attempt a [[Performance]] check.
	- **Critical Success:** Your performance impresses the observers, and they're likely to share stories of your ability.  
	- **Success:** You prove yourself, and observers appreciate the quality of your performance. 
	- **Failure:** Your performance falls flat.  
	- **Critical Failure:** You demonstrate only incompetence.
