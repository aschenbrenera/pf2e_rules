## Mechanical Rules

- Choose one of your effects that has a sustained duration or lists a special benefit when you Sustain it. 
	- If the effect has a sustained duration, its duration extends until the end of your next turn. (Sustaining more than once in the same turn doesn't extend the duration to subsequent turns.)
	- If an ability can be sustained but doesn't list how long, it can be sustained up to 10 minutes.
	- If your Sustain action is disrupted, the ability ends.
