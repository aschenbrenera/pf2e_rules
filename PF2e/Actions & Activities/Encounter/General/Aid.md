**Actions:** [reaction] ⤾
**Trigger**: An ally is about to use an action that requires a skill check or attack roll.  
**Requirements:** The ally is willing to accept your aid, and you have prepared to help.
**Description:** You try to help your ally with a task.

## Mechanical Rules

 - To use this reaction, you must first prepare to help, usually by using an action during your turn. You must explain to the GM exactly how you're trying to help, and they determine whether you can Aid your ally.  
	 - **Long Tasks:** For a task that takes longer than a round, you often need to spend more than one action preparing to help, as determined by the GM.
	 - **Repetition:** Aiding the same creature multiple times can have diminishing returns. In particular, if you try to repeatedly Aid attacks or skill checks against a creature, the GM will usually increase the DC each time as your foe gets more savvy. This isn't the case if there's no reason the task would be less likely to work if repeated, such as Aiding someone who's climbing a wall or picking a lock.
 - The GM can add any relevant traits to your preparatory action or to your Aid reaction depending on the situation, or even allow you to Aid checks other than skill checks and attack rolls.  
 - When you use your Aid reaction, attempt a skill check or attack roll of a type decided by the GM. The typical DC is 15, but the GM might adjust this DC for particularly hard or easy tasks.
	 - **Critical Success:** You grant your ally a +2 circumstance bonus to the triggering check. If you're a master with the check you attempted, the bonus is +3, and if you're legendary, it's +4.  
	 - **Success:** You grant your ally a +1 circumstance bonus to the triggering check.  
	 - **Critical Failure:** Your ally takes a –1 circumstance penalty to the triggering check.
