**Actions:** [1] ⬥
**Traits:** `MANIPULATE` 
**Skill:** [[Thievery]]
**Requirements:** You are trained in Thievery.
**Description:** This action allows you to disarm a trap or another complex device. 

## Mechanical Rules

- Often, a device requires numerous successes before becoming disabled, depending on its construction and complexity. Your attempted [[Thievery]] check result determines your progress.  
	- **Critical Success:** You disable the device, or you achieve two successes toward disabling a device requiring more than one success. You leave no trace of your tampering, and you can rearm the device later, if that type of device can be rearmed.  
	- **Success:** You disable the device, or you achieve one success toward disabling a device that requires more than one success.  
	- **Critical Failure:** You trigger the device.
- A [[Thieves' toolkit]] is helpful and sometimes even required to Disable a Device, as determined by the GM, and sometimes a device requires a higher proficiency rank in Thievery to disable it.  
  

## Gameplay Interactions

 - If you wear your thieves' toolkit, you can draw and replace it as part of the action that uses it.
