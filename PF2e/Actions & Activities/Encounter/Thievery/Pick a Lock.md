**Actions:** [2] ⬥⬥
**Traits:** `MANIPULATE` 
**Skill:** [[Thievery]]
**Requirements:** You're holding or wearing a [[Thieves' toolkit]]. You are trained in Thievery.
**Description:** You pick up a small, unattended object and try not to be noticed.

## Mechanical Rules

- Often, a lock requires numerous successes before opening, depending on its construction and complexity. Your attempted [[Thievery]] check result determines your progress.  
	- **Critical Success:** You unlock the lock, or you achieve two successes toward opening a lock that requires more than one success. You leave no trace of your tampering.  
	- **Success:** You open the lock, or you achieve one success toward opening a lock that requires more than one success. You leave behind damage that indicates the lock was picked on close scrutiny.  
	- **Critical Failure:** Your toolkit is [[Broken]] and you leave behind obvious damage.
- If you lack the proper tools, the GM might let you use improvised picks, which are treated as a shoddy toolkit (–2 item penalty).  

| **Type of Lock** | **Price** | **DC** | Required Successes |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Poor             | 2 sp      | 15     | 2                  |
| Simple           | 2 gp      | 20     | 3                  |
| Average          | 15 gp     | 25     | 4                  |
| Good             | 200 gp    | 30     | 5                  |
| Superior         | 4,500 gp  | 40     | 6                  |

## Gameplay Interactions

 - If you wear your thieves' toolkit, you can draw and replace it as part of the action that uses it.
 - If your thieves' toolkit is broken, you can repair it by replacing the lock picks with replacement picks appropriate to your toolkit (standard 3 sp,  infiltrator 3 gp).
