## Mechanical Rules

- Attempt a [[Deception]] check against your target's Perception DC.  
	- **Critical Success:** You throw your enemy's defenses against you entirely off. The target is [[Off-Guard]] against melee attacks that you attempt against it until the end of your next turn.  
	- **Success** Your foe is fooled, but only momentarily. The target is off-guard against the next melee attack that you attempt against it before the end of your current turn.  
	- **Critical Failure** Your feint backfires. You are off-guard against melee attacks the target attempts against you until the end of your next turn.
