**Actions:** [1] ⬥
**Traits:** `MOVE`
**Skill:** [[Acrobatics]]
**Requirement:** You are in a square that contains a [narrow surface](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=455), [uneven ground](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=456), or another similar feature.

## Mechanical Rules

- You move across a narrow surface or uneven ground, attempting an [[Acrobatics]] check against its Balance DC.
	- **Critical Success:** You move up to your Speed.  
	- **Success:** You move up to your Speed, treating it as [[Difficult terrain]] (every 5 feet costs 10 feet of movement).  
	- **Failure:** You must remain stationary to keep your balance (wasting the action) or you [[Falling|Fall]]. If you fall, your turn ends.  
	- **Critical Failure:** You fall and your turn ends.
- You are [[Off-Guard]] while on a narrow surface or uneven ground.

## Gameplay Interactions

 - Each time you are hit by an attack or fail a save on a narrow surface or uneven ground, you must succeed at a Reflex save (with the same DC as the Acrobatics check to Balance) or fall (off or prone respectively).
