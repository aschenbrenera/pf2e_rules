**Actions:** [1] ⬥
**Traits:** `MOVE` 
**Skill:** [[Acrobatics]]

## Mechanical Rules

- You can try to move through the space of one enemy.
-   You Stride up to your Speed and attempt an [[Acrobatics]] check against the enemy's Reflex DC as soon as you try to enter its space.
	- You can Tumble Through using [[Climb]], [[Fly]], [[Swim]], or another action instead of Stride in the appropriate environment. 
	- **Success:** You move through the enemy's space, treating the squares in its space as [[Difficult terrain]] (every 5 feet costs 10 feet of movement). If you don't have enough Speed to move all the way through its space, you get the same effect as a failure.  
	- **Failure:** Your movement ends, and you trigger reactions as if you had moved out of the square you started in.
