**Actions:** [1] ⬥
**Traits:** `MOVE` 
**Skill:** [[Athletics]]
**Requirements:** You have two hands free.

## Mechanical Rules

- You attempt an [[Athletics]] check to move a maximum distance of 5 feet up, down, or across an incline.
	- **Critical Success:** You move along the incline, increasing the maximum distance by 5 feet.  
	- **Success:** You move along the incline.  
	- **Critical Failure:** You fall. If you began the climb on stable ground, you fall and land [[Prone]].
- You're [[Off-Guard]] while climbing unless you have a climb Speed.
	- You take a –2 circumstance penalty to AC.
- If your land Speed is 40 feet or higher, increase the maximum distance by 5 feet for every 20 feet of Speed above 20 feet. 
- The GM determines the DC based on the nature of the incline and environmental circumstances; you might get an automatic critical success on an incline that's trivial to climb.
