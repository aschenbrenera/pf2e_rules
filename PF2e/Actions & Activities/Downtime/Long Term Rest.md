**Description**: You can spend an entire day and night resting to recover

## Mechanical Rules

- Each full 24-hour period a character spends resting during downtime allows them to recover double what they would for an 8-hour rest.
	- Recover Hit Points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1) multiplied by double your level.
	- They must spend this time resting in a comfortable and secure location, typically in bed.
- If they spend significantly longer in bed rest—usually from a few days to a week of downtime—they recover from all damage and most nonpermanent conditions.
	- Characters affected by diseases, long-lasting poisons, or similar afflictions might need to continue attempting saves during downtime.
- Some curses, permanent injuries, and other situations that require magic or special care to remove don't end automatically during long-term rest.
