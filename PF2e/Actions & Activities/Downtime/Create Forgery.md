**Traits:** `DOWNTIME` `SECRET`
**Skill:** [[Society]]
**Requirements:** You provide the proper writing materials for your forgery. You are trained in Society.
**Description**: You create a forged document, usually over the course of a day or a week.
## Mechanical Rules

-  If you need to forge a specific person's handwriting, you need a sample of that person's handwriting. Otherwise, you need only to have seen a similar document, and you gain up to a +4 circumstance bonus to the check (the GM determines the bonus).  
- The GM rolls a secret DC 20 [[Society]] check.
	- **Success:** The forgery is of good enough quality that passive observers can't notice the fake (but see Examine Forgery).  
	- **Failure:** The forgery has some obvious signs of being a fake, potentially allowing passive observers to detect it. Each time a passive observer sees the document, the GM compares your check result to the observer's Perception DC or Society DC, whichever is higher. If your result doesn't exceed a passive observer's DC, that observer knows the document is a forgery.

## Gameplay Interaction

-  If an observer wants to [[Examine Forgery]], they attempt a Perception or Society check against the forger's Society DC. Any bonus the forger had to create the forgery initially applies to this DC.
	- **Success:** The examiner knows the document is a forgery. 
	- **Failure:** The examiner thinks the document is genuine and can't try again unless they get a new reason to be suspicious of the document.
