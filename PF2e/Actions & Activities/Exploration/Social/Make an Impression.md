## Gameplay Interaction

Your influence on NPCs is measured with a set of attitudes that reflect how they view your character. These are only a brief summary of a creature's disposition. The GM will supply additional nuance based on the history and beliefs of the characters you're interacting with, and their attitudes can change in accordance with the story. 

- [[Helpful]]: Willing to help you and responds favorably to your requests.
- [[Friendly]]: Has a good attitude toward you, but won't necessarily stick their neck out to help you.
- [[Indifferent]]: Doesn't care about you either way. (Most NPCs start out indifferent.)
- [[Unfriendly]]: Dislikes you and doesn't want to help you.
- [[Hostile]]: Actively works against you—and might attack you just because of their dislike.
