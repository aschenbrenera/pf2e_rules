**Skill:** [[Acrobatics]]
**Requirements:**  You are trained in Acrobatics.
**Description:** You contort yourself to squeeze through a space so small you can barely fit through. This action is for exceptionally small spaces; many tight spaces are difficult terrain that you can move through more quickly and without a check. 


## Mechanical Rules

- Make an [[Acrobatics]] check against a DC the GM sets.
	- **Critical Success:** You squeeze through the tight space in 1 minute per 10 feet of squeezing. 
	- **Success:** You squeeze through in 1 minute per 5 feet.  
	- **Critical Failure:** You become stuck in the tight space. While you're stuck, you can spend 1 minute attempting another Acrobatics check at the same DC. Any result on that check other than a critical failure causes you to become unstuck.
