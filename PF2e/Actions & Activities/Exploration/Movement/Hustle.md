**Traits:** `EXPLORATION` `MOVE`
**Description:** You strain yourself to move quickly.

## Mechanical Rules

- Move at double your travel speed. 
- You can Hustle only for a number of minutes equal to your Constitution modifier Ã— 10 (minimum 10 minutes).
	- If you are in a group that is Hustling, use the lowest Constitution modifier among everyone to determine how fast the group can Hustle together.

## Gameplay Tips

- It's not stated explicitly how to handle how often someone can hustle. Here are some possible rules.
	- The rule defines the max time you can spend Hustling per day. If so, the GM could choose to assign the Fatigued condition when a character reaches their max.
	- Alternatively, the rule defines a rechargeable capacity to Hustle. For every 10 minutes spent in the same location, you regain that amount of capacity to Hustle up to your maximum.
