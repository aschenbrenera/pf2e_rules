**Traits:**  `EXPLORATION` `CONCENTRATE` `MOVE`
**Description:** You cover your tracks.

## Mechanical Rules

- Travel at half speed.
-  If you're Avoiding Notice at the start of an encounter, you usually roll a Stealth check instead of a Perception check both to determine your initiative and to see if the enemies notice you as described on [[Surprise Round Replaced|Stealth into Encounter]] (shown below).
- You can not perform another activity with the `EXPLORATION` tag while using avoid notice.
  
- (There is some debate on how the following rules are intended, this seems to be the most consistent tabletop method)
- You make a publicÂ [[Stealth]] check.
	- The GM decides how far or how long that check can be used, and determines if you are noticed by creatures based on their Perception DC as normal for [[Sneak]].

## Gameplay Interaction

- Anyone who is using [[Avoid Notice]] can attempt a Stealth check for their initiative.
	- All the normal bonuses and penalties apply, including any bonus for having [[Cover]].
	- You can give them the option to roll Perception instead, but if they do, they forsake their Stealth and are definitely going to be detected.  
- To determine whether someone is [[Undetected]] by other participants in the encounter, you still compare their Stealth check for initiative to the Perception DC of their enemies. They're Undetected by anyone whose DC they meet or exceed.
- If a creature starts their turn with all enemies Undetected, the GM determines if the enemies are also [[Detection|Unnoticed]].
	- If all of the creature's enemies are Unnoticed, the creature carries on with it's regular activities while in initiative, unaware of the enemies presence.
	- Otherwise, the creature knows someone is around and may start moving about, using [[Seek]] or otherwise preparing to fight.
