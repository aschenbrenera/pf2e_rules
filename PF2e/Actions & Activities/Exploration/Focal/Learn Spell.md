**Traits:** `EXPLORATION` `CONCENTRATE`
**Skills:** [[Arcana]], [[Nature]], [[Occultism]], [[Religion]]
**Requirements** You have a spellcasting class feature, and the spell you want to learn is on your magical tradition's spell list. You are trained in the relevant skill.
**Description:** You can gain access to a new spell of your tradition from someone who knows that spell or from magical writing like a spellbook or scroll.
## Mechanical Rules

- If you can cast spells of multiple traditions, you can Learn a Spell of any of those traditions, but you must use the corresponding skill to do so.
- Spend 1 hour per spell rank, during which you must remain in conversation with a person who knows the spell or have the magical writing in your possession.
- Have materials with the Price indicated in the Learning a Spell table.
- Attempt a skill check for the skill corresponding to your tradition (DC determined by the GM using [[Identifying and Learning]]) or shown below (Uncommon +2, Rare +5, Unique +10). Attempt a check with the relevant skill.
	- **Critical Success:** You expend half the materials and learn the spell.  
	- **Success:** You expend the materials and learn the spell.  
	- **Failure:** You fail to learn the spell but can try again after you gain a level. The materials aren't expended.  
	- **Critical Failure:** As failure, except you expend half the materials.
- A spell you learn is added to your repository of spells, such as a spellbook for a wizard, familiar for a witch, or spell list for a cleric or druid. If you have a spell repertoire, such as a bard, it's not automatically added since you can only know a limited number of spells. Instead, you can select it when you add or swap spells.
