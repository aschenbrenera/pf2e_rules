**Traits:**  `EXPLORATION` `CONCENTRATE` `SECRET` 
**Skill:** [[Society]]
**Description:** A creature on the lookout for forgeries, even one who was fooled on a passive glance, can take time to closely examine a document to see if it's a forgery. They apply different techniques and analysis methods to look beyond the surface elements.
## Mechanical Rules

- If a PC examines a genuine document, the GM might still pretend to roll a secret check before revealing the document is genuine.
- Attempt a secret Perception or [[Society]] check against the forger's Society DC. Any bonus the forger had to create the forgery initially applies to this DC.
	- **Success:** The examiner knows the document is a forgery. 
	- **Failure:** The examiner thinks the document is genuine and can't try again unless they get a new reason to be suspicious of the document.
