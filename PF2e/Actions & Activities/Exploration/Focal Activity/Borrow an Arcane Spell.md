**Traits:** `EXPLORATION` `CONCENTRATE`
**Skills:** [[Arcana]]
**Requirements:** You are trained in Arcana.
**Description:** If you're an arcane spellcaster who prepares spells, you can attempt to prepare a spell from someone else's arcane spellbook, arcane witch familiar, or the like.

## Mechanical Rules

- You can only use this activity during your [[Rest|Daily Preparations]] or during time you are otherwise permitted prepare spells.
- The GM sets the DC for the check based on the spell's rank and rarity; it's typically a bit easier than to [[Learn Spell]]. Attempt a [[Arcana]] check.
	- **Success:** You prepare the borrowed spell as part of your normal spell preparation.  
	- **Failure:** You fail to prepare the spell, but the spell slot remains available for you to prepare a different spell. You can't try to borrow this spell again until the next time you prepare spells.
