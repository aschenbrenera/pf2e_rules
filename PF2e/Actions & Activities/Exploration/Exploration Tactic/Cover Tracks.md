**Traits:**  `EXPLORATION` `CONCENTRATE` `MOVE`
**Skill:** [[Survival]]
**Requirements:** You are trained in Survival.
**Description:** You cover your tracks.

## Mechanical Rules

- Move up to half your [[Travel speed]].
- You don't need to attempt a [[Survival]] check to cover your tracks, but anyone attempting to [[Track]] you must succeed at a Survival check against your Survival DC if it is higher than the normal DC to Track.  
- In some cases, you might Cover Tracks in an encounter. In this case, Cover Tracks is a single action and doesn't have the exploration trait.
