**Traits:**  `EXPLORATION` `CONCENTRATE`
**Description:** You look meticulously for hidden doors, concealed hazards, and so on.

## Mechanical Rules

-  Searching reduces your [[Travel speed]]. Move at half speed. You can always choose to move more slowly to search more thoroughly. 
	- If your searching speed is greater than 15 feet (150 feet per minute), you can't ensure you check everything before you walk into it ([[Detecting Hazards and Traps]]).
	- If your searching speed is greater than 30 feet (300 feet per minute), you can't search thoroughly guaranteeing you checked everything.
	- In locations with many objects to search, you have to stop and spend significantly longer to search thoroughly.
- If you are searching an area that contains at least one [[Hidden]]  or [[Undetected]] door, creature, item, trap, or hazard, the GM will attempt a secret Perception check. You notice hidden things in that area as determined by the result of your check as described in the [[Seek]] action.
	- **Critical Success:** Any undetected or hidden creature you critically succeeded against becomes observed by you. You learn the location of objects in the area you critically succeeded against.  
	- **Success:** Any undetected creature you succeeded against becomes hidden from you instead of undetected, and any hidden creature you succeeded against becomes observed by you. You learn the location of any object or get a clue to its whereabouts, as determined by the GM.
 
## Gameplay Interaction

- An object or creature you detect might remain hidden, rather than becoming [[Detection|Observed]], if you're using an [[Senses|Imprecise Sense]] sense or if an effect (such as Invisibility) prevents the subject from being observed.  
- The [[Expeditious Search]] feat increases how quickly you can search. These are your new limits.
	- If your searching speed is greater than 30 feet (300 feet per minute), you can't ensure you check everything before you walk into it.
	- If your searching speed is greater than 60 feet (600 feet per minute), you can't search thoroughly guaranteeing you checked everything.
	- If you’re legendary in Perception, double the above limits.
