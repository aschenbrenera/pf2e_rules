**Traits:**  `EXPLORATION` `CONCENTRATE` `MOVE`
**Description:** Explore stealthily. 

## Mechanical Rules

- Travel at half speed.
-  If you're Avoiding Notice at the start of an encounter, you usually are allowed to roll a [[Stealth]] check instead of a Perception check both to determine your initiative and to see if the enemies notice you.
	- All the normal Stealth check bonuses and penalties apply, including any bonus for having [[Cover]].
	- To determine your [[Detection]] level by enemies, you compare your Stealth check for initiative to the Perception DC of all enemies (as normal for [[Sneak]]).
		- **Success:** You're [[Undetected]] by the creature.  
		- **Failure:** You're [[Hidden]] from the creature.
		- **Critical Failure:** You're [[Detection|Observed]] by the creature. If you're Invisible you are Hidden instead.
	- If you start your first turn Undetected by all enemies, the GM determines if you are also [[Detection|Unnoticed]].
	- You can roll Perception instead, but you forsake Stealth and become Observed.

**Interpretation:** There is some debate on how the following. The rules don't implicitly give any benefit for Avoiding Notice until the call for initiative. That being said, the following tabletop rule seems to be widely adopted.
  - When undertaking Avoid Notice, you make a Stealth check (secret at GM Discretion).
	- The GM decides how far or how long that check can be used during exploration. Typically the check is rerolled when any relevant circumstance has changed.
	- The GM may use this check to determine if you are noticed during exploration by creatures based on their Perception DC. Success does not guarantee avoidance of an encounter, but may be used to change how and when a scene unfolds.

## Gameplay Interaction

- Rogues have a feature called [[Surprise Attack]] that can be triggered by Avoid Notice.
	- On the first round of combat, if you roll Deception or Stealth for initiative, creatures that haven't acted are Off-Guard to you.

## Gameplay Tip

- There are no 'Surprise Round' rules in PF2e.
- A more comprehensive GM description of Avoid Notice can be found in [[Entering Initiative with Stealth|Stealth into Encounter]] .
