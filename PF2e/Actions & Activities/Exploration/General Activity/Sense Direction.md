**Traits:**  `EXPLORATION` `SECRET`
**Skill:** [[Survival]]
**Description:** Using the stars, the position of the sun, traits of the geography or flora, or the behavior of fauna, you can stay oriented in the wild.

## Mechanical Rules

- Typically, you only Sense Direction only once per day, but some environments or changes might necessitate rolling more often.
- More unusual locales or those you're unfamiliar with might require you to have a minimum proficiency rank to Sense Direction.
- The GM determines the DC and how long this activity takes (usually just a minute or so).
- Without a [[Compass]] you take a –2 item penalty to checks to Sense Direction.  
- Attempt a [[Survival]] check.
	- **Critical Success:** You get an excellent sense of where you are. If you are in an environment with cardinal directions, you know them exactly.  
	- **Success:** You gain enough orientation to avoid becoming hopelessly lost. If you are in an environment with cardinal directions, you have a sense of those directions.
