**Description:** You follow an ally's expertise in an exploration activity.  
## Mechanical Rules

- Choose an ally attempting a recurring skill check while exploring, such as climbing, or performing a different exploration tactic that requires a skill check. You match their tactic or attempt similar skill checks.
	- The ally must be at least an expert in that skill and must be willing to provide assistance. 
- You can add your level as a proficiency bonus to the associated skill check, even if you're untrained.
- Additionally, you gain a circumstance bonus to your skill check based on your ally's proficiency (+2 for expert, +3 for master, and +4 for legendary).
