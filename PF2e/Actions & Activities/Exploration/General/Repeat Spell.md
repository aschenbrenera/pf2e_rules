**Traits:** `EXPLORATION` `CONCENTRATE`

You repeatedly cast the same spell while moving at half speed. Typically, this spell is a cantrip that you want to have in effect in the event a combat breaks out, and it must be one you can cast in 2 actions or fewer. Repeating a spell that requires making complex decisions, such as [_figment_](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1528), can make you [[Fatigued]], as determined by the GM.
