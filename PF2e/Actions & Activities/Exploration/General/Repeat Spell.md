**Traits:** `EXPLORATION` `CONCENTRATE`
**Description:** You repeatedly cast the same spell. Typically, this spell is a cantripÂ that you want to have in effect in the event a combat breaks out.

##  Mechanical Rules
 
- Move up to half your [[Travel speed]].
- Cast a spell (usually a cantrip) that you can cast in 2 actions or fewer. 
- Repeating a spell that requires making complex decisions, can make you [[Fatigued]], as determined by the GM.
- When casting [[Detect Magic]]:
	- If your speed is greater than 15 feet (150 feet per minute), you can't ensure you detect magic auras before you walk into it ([[Detecting Hazards and Traps]]).
	- If your speed is greater than 30 feet (300 feet per minute), you can't guarantee you detect all magic auras.
