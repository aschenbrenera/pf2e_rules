**Actions:** [1] ⬥
**Traits:** `CONCENTRATE` `SECRET`
**Skill:** [[Deception]]
**Description:** You scan an area for signs of creatures or objects, possibly including secret doors or hazards. 
## Mechanical Rules

- Choose an area to scan. The GM determines the area you can scan with one Seek action—almost always 30 feet or less in any dimension. The GM might impose a penalty if you search far away from you or adjust the number of actions it takes to Seek a particularly cluttered area. 
- The GM attempts a single secret Perception check for you and compares the result to the Stealth DCs of any [[Undetected]] or [[Hidden]] creatures in the area, or the DC to detect each object in the area (as determined by the GM or by someone using [[Conceal an Object]]. A creature you detect might remain hidden, rather than becoming [[Detection|Observed]], if you're using an [[Senses|Imprecise Sense]] sense or if an effect (such as [[Invisible|Invisibility]]) prevents the subject from being observed.  
	- **Critical Success:** Any undetected or hidden creature you critically succeeded against becomes observed by you. You learn the location of objects in the area you critically succeeded against.  
	- **Success:** Any undetected creature you succeeded against becomes hidden from you instead of undetected, and any hidden creature you succeeded against becomes observed by you. You learn the location of any object or get a clue to its whereabouts, as determined by the GM.
