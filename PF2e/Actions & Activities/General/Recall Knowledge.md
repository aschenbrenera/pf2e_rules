Traits: `CONCENTRATE` `SECRET`

**Description:** You attempt a skill check to try to remember a bit of knowledge regarding a topic related to that skill.

## Mechanical Rules

- Suggest which skill you'd like to use and ask the GM a question about specific knowledge. The GM determines the DC and then makes a secret roll.
	- Example questions on creatures:  
		- What is it?
		- What is the creature's most notable offensive or defensive ability?
		- What are the creature's most notable vulnerabilities or strengths?   (Lowest of AC, Reflex, Fortitude, and Will, or a Weakness) (Resistances, Immunities)
		- What are the creature's Traits, Languages, or Skills.
	- Topics by skill:
		- Arcana: Arcane theories, magical traditions, arcane planes, constructs, dragons, elementals, and beasts
		- Crafting: Alchemical reactions, item value, engineering, unusual materials, and constructs
		- Medicine: Diseases, poisons, wounds, and forensics
		- Nature: The environment, weather, natural planes, animals, beasts, elementals, fey, fungus, and plants
		- Occultism: Ancient mysteries, superstitions, obscure philosophy, esoteric planes, aberrations, astrals, dreams, ethereals, oozes, spirits, and times
		- Religion: Divine agents, divine planes, theology, obscure myths, celestials, fiends, monitors, shades, and undead
		- Society: Local history, key personalities, legal institutions, humanoids and their societal structure and culture
	- **Critical Success**: The GM answers your question truthfully and either tells you additional information or context, or answers one followup question.
	- **Success**: The GM answers your question truthfully.
	- **Failure**: The GM gives you no information.
	- **Critical Failure**: The GM answers your question falsely (or decides to give you no information, as on a failure).
