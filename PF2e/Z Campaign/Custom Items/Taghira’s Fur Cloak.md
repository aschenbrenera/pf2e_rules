**Backstory:** This fur cloak was crafted from the hide of Storsult, the winter wolf that Taghira slew during his right of passage. When he and the other prospects were sent out to discover more about the monsters attacking the tribe, the cloak was given to him by his mother. Though its craftsmanship appears a bit rugged, the hide is expertly tanned, and the fur is well preserved. A clasp made with one of Storsult’s fangs adorns the center of the cloak. 

The hide itself had latent powers of the winter wolf. Unknown to Taghira at the time, Saddha  tapped into those powers and used her magic to imbue the cloak with blessing of the hunt when she crafted it.
